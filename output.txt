And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
And from her womb children of divers kind
And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
And stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell

Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,
I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him

I have been feasting with mine enemy,
I have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.

I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
I stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves
I warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
I will follow you.
I will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a
I would I were thy bird.
If ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
In man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;
In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
Is it good-den?
Is your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,
It is my soul that calls upon my name.

SCENE IV. A Street.
Shall I send to thee?
She will endite him to some supper.
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
So thrive my soul,—
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,
Stop there, stop there.
Sure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,
Sweet, so would I:
Swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.
That’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow
That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies
That’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
That lets it hop a little from her hand,
That thou consent to marry us today.
The day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,
The earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;
The grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,
The other did not so.
The pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners
The slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
The what?
Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline,
Thou art uprous’d with some distemperature;
Thou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Thou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
To lay one in, another out to have.
To lure this tassel-gentle back again.
To season love, that of it doth not taste.
To turn your households’ rancour to pure love.
Tomorrow will I send.
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
What hast thou found?
What is her burying grave, that is her womb:
What o’clock tomorrow
What say’st thou, my dear Nurse?
What wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?
Which to the high topgallant of my joy
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
