Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—
Is to himself—I will not say how true—
No, marry; I fear thee!
Clubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,
The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
The which, if you with patient ears attend,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
I do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
That westward rooteth from this city side,
And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
You, Capulet, shall go along with me,
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
To know our farther pleasure in this case,
But to himself so secret and so close,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,
Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Being one too many by my weary self,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
If ever you disturb our streets again,
And Montague, come you this afternoon,
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
But he, his own affections’ counsellor,
He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,
Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,
 [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
So far from sounding and discovery,
Two households, both alike in dignity,

’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
Good morrow, cousin.

Both by myself and many other friends;
Citizens of Verona; several Men and Women, relations to both houses;
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
Is the day so young?
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
How? Turn thy back and run?
Do you quarrel, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
The heads of the maids?
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Have you importun’d him by any means?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Is the law of our side if I say ay?
O where is Romeo, saw you him today?
