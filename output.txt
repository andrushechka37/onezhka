A Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
A bears him like a portly gentleman;
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;
A challenge, on my life.
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
A fair assembly. [_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come?
A fortnight and odd days.
A gentleman of noble parentage,
A gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak
A gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,
A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.
A greater power than we can contradict
A hall, a hall, give room! And foot it, girls.
A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!
A lightning before death. O, how may I
A lover may bestride the gossamers
A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man
A most courteous exposition.
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
A peevish self-will’d harlotry it is.
A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
A plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
A rhyme I learn’d even now
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
A right good markman, and she’s fair I love.
A sail, a sail!
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,
A sleeping potion, which so took effect
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
A thousand times good night.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,
A villain that is hither come in spite,
A visor for a visor. What care I
A was a merry man,—took up the child:
A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,
A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,
A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.

Abate thy valour in the acting it.
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
Accurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day.
Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
Affliction is enanmour’d of thy parts
Afore me, it is so very very late that we
After the prompter, for our entrance:
Again in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light
Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,
Ah my mistresses, which of you all
Ah sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.
Ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well.
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Ah, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,
Ah, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!
Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.
Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Alas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black
Alas that love so gentle in his view,
Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead!
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
All night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick.
All our whole city is much bound to him.
All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,
All things that we ordained festival
All this I know; and to the marriage
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
Am I like such a fellow?
Am I the master here, or you? Go to.
Amen, amen, but come what sorrow can,
Amen.
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
An Apothecary.
An Officer.
An alligator stuff’d, and other skins
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
An honour! Were not I thine only nurse,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
And I’ll believe thee.
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
And I am proof against their enmity.
And I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?
And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,
And I, for winking at your discords too,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
And Montague, come you this afternoon,
And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee
And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,
And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.
And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,
And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
And a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier
And all combin’d, save what thou must combine
And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay
And all the better is it for the maid.
And all things change them to the contrary.
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
And all this day an unaccustom’d spirit
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
And art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.
And bad’st me bury love.
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
And bear this work of heaven with patience.
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
And breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
And by and by my master drew on him,
And cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight.
And darkness fleckled like a drunkard reels
And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.
And do not interrupt me in my course.
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,
And fall upon the ground as I do now,
And fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
And fearfully did menace me with death
And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
And fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
And for that offence
And for thy name, which is no part of thee,
And from her womb children of divers kind
And from my soul too,
And gave him what becomed love I might,
And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.
And go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare
And he shall signify from time to time
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
And her immortal part with angels lives.
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
And here is come to do some villanous shame
And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.
And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.
And his to me.
And hither shall he come, and he and I
And if a man did need a poison now,
And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.
And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food.
And in her best array bear her to church;
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,
And in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.
And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,
And in the taste confounds the appetite.
And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,
And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death
And in this state she gallops night by night
And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.
And joy comes well in such a needy time.
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
And know their spring, their head, their true descent,
And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
And leave him all; life, living, all is death’s.
And let mischance be slave to patience.
And let the nurse this night sit up with you,
And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
And made Verona’s ancient citizens
And madly play with my forefathers’ joints?
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
And makes himself an artificial night.
And may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
And needly will be rank’d with other griefs,
And never from this palace of dim night
And never trouble Peter for the matter.
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
And not impute this yielding to light love,
And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
And on my life hath stol’n him home to bed.
And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
And pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And presently took post to tell it you.
And private in his chamber pens himself,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
And reason coldly of your grievances,
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?
And see how he will take it at your hands.
And see how one another lends content;
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
And she agree, within her scope of choice
And she as much in love, her means much less
And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks:
And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,
And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
And since that time it is eleven years;
And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
And so did I.
And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
And so good Capulet, which name I tender
And soar with them above a common bound.
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,
And stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
And steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour
And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.
And stole into the covert of the wood.
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
And that bare vowel I shall poison more
And that my master slew him.
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
And that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath
And that we have a curse in having her.
And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
And then I ran away to call the watch.
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
And then down falls again.
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And then in post he came from Mantua
And then my husband,—God be with his soul!
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
And then will I be general of your woes,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
And therefore have I little talk’d of love;
And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:
And these who, often drown’d, could never die,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off,
And this same needy man must sell it me.
And this shall free thee from this present shame,
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.
And thou art wedded to calamity.
And thou dismember’d with thine own defence.
And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,
And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I
And too soon marr’d are those so early made.
And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
And turn’d that black word death to banishment.
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.
And usest none in that true use indeed
And vice sometime’s by action dignified.
And we mean well in going to this mask;
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
And what love can do, that dares love attempt:
And what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,
And what to?
And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
And where the worser is predominant,
And why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
And with my child my joys are buried.
And with this knife I’ll help it presently.
And with wild looks, bid me devise some means
And world’s exile is death. Then banished
And yet I warrant it had upon it brow
And yet I wish but for the thing I have;
And yet I would it were to give again.
And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
And yet not proud. Mistress minion you,
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,
And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
And you re us and fa us, you note us.
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,
And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
Anon, anon!
Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true.

Are made already mothers. By my count
Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,
Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you
Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.
Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
As I intended, for it wrought on her
As I remember, this should be the house.
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
As Phaeton would whip you to the west
As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear;
As all the world—why he’s a man of wax.
As are behoveful for our state tomorrow.
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,
As he was coming from this churchyard side.
As if that name,
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
As is a winged messenger of heaven
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
As is the night before some festival
As living here and you no use of him.
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,
As signal that thou hear’st something approach.
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
As that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.
As that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,
As violently as hasty powder fir’d
As will disperse itself through all the veins,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.
As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
At my poor house look to behold this night
At some hours in the night spirits resort—
At the prefixed hour of her waking
At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s
At thy good heart’s oppression.
Author: William Shakespeare
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
Away to heaven respective lenity,
Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the
Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
Ay madam, from the reach of these my hands.
Ay me, sad hours seem long.
Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?
Ay me.
Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
Ay, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
Ay, a thousand times. Peter!
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.
Ay, ay, the cords.
Ay, boy, ready.
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
Ay, forsooth.
Ay, let the County take you in your bed,
Ay, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense
Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse,
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;

Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,
Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;
Be heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more
Be not her maid since she is envious;
Be not so long to speak. I long to die,
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame!
Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.
Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,
Be shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.
Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,
Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
Because he married me before to Romeo?
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Before and apace.
Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Beguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain.
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;
Being but heavy I will bear the light.
Being held a foe, he may not have access
Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
Being one too many by my weary self,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;
Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Being the time the potion’s force should cease.
Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
Belonging to a man. O be some other name.
Benedicite!
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
Beshrew your heart for sending me about
Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,
Bid her devise
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.
Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,
Blister’d be thy tongue
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,
Both by myself and many other friends;
Both you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.
But ’tis no wit to go.
But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine
But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
But I can give thee more,
But I pray, can you read anything you see?
But I will watch you from such watching now.
But I will write again to Mantua,
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
But Montague is bound as well as I,
But O, it presses to my memory
But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.
But Romeo may not, he is banished.
But Romeo may not. More validity,
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
But banished to kill me? Banished?
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
But come young waverer, come go with me,
But every man betake him to his legs.
But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next
But for the sunset of my brother’s son
But he that hath the steerage of my course
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
But he, his own affections’ counsellor,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
But if thou jealous dost return to pry
But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d
But let them measure us by what they will,
But like a misshaped and sullen wench,
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
But love thee better than thou canst devise
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
But my true love is grown to such excess,
But new struck nine.
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
But now I see this one is one too much,
But now my lord, what say you to my suit?
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
But saying o’er what I have said before.
But send him back.
But she’s best married that dies married young.
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
But thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.
But to be frank and give it thee again.
But to himself so secret and so close,
But to his foe suppos’d he must complain,
But to rejoice in splendour of my own.
But to the earth some special good doth give;
But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true
But when I came, some minute ere the time
But where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
But, soft, what day is this?
By’r Lady, thirty years.
By a name
By and by I come—
By any other name would smell as sweet;
By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown.
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
By having him, making yourself no less.
By heaven I love thee better than myself;
By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,
By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,
By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;
By my head, here comes the Capulets.
By my heel, I care not.
By my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,
By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,
By playing it to me with so sour a face.
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
By the hour of nine.
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,
By urging me to fury. O be gone.
By whose direction found’st thou out this place?

Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;
Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife,
Call, good Mercutio.
Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Can I demand.
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Can heaven be so envious?
Can vengeance be pursu’d further than death?
Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,

Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
Come cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,
Come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,
Come hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?
Come hither, cover’d with an antic face,
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
Come let’s away, the strangers all are gone.
Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!
Come you to make confession to this father?
Come, Montague, for thou art early up,
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.
Come, come with me, and we will make short work,
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me

Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about
Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.

Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

Could to no issue of true honour bring.

Could you not take some occasion without giving?

Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead,
Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.
Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,
Defect you cause.
Delay this marriage for a month, a week,
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
Depart again. Here, here will I remain
Despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d.
Despised substance of divinest show!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Direct my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!
Displant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
Do not deny to him that you love me.
Do not swear at all.
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you quarrel, sir?
Doing more murder in this loathsome world
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,
Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?
Dost thou not laugh?
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.
Doth make against me, of this direful murder.
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
Doth not she think me an old murderer,
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
Doting like me, and like me banished,
Dove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow.
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Driving back shadows over lowering hills:
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
ESCALUS, Prince of Verona.
Each part depriv’d of supple government,
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
Either withdraw unto some private place,
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.
Environed with all these hideous fears,
Ere I again behold my Romeo.
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Evermore showering? In one little body
Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?
Every good hap to you that chances here.
Examine every married lineament,
Examine other beauties.

Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
Faith, I know not what to say.
Faith, here it is.
Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
Farewell!
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.
Farewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;
Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Farewell, dear father.
Farewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.
Farewell, my coz.
Farewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!
Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.

Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?
Fear me not.
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Feeling so the loss,
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
Fie, fie! What, are you mad?
Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!
Fifth Act, at Mantua.
Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that the
Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
For ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d
For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,
For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,
For I am sure you have your hands full all
For I come hither arm’d against myself.
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
For I have need of many orisons
For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.
For I will raise her statue in pure gold,
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.
For beauty starv’d with her severity,
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
For by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
For even the day before she broke her brow,
For exile hath more terror in his look,
For fair without the fair within to hide.
For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
For here we need it not.
For in a minute there are many days.
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
For it was bad enough before their spite.
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
For never was a story of more woe
For nothing can be ill if she be well.
For now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
For shame, bring Juliet forth, her lord is come.
For so he said he would. I hear him near.
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
For then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long
For this alliance may so happy prove,
For this night’s watching.
For this time all the rest depart away:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
For though fond nature bids us all lament,
For well you know this is a pitiful case.
For what, I pray thee?
For who is living, if those two are gone?
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
For you and I are past our dancing days;
For your broken shin.
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
Forgetting any other home but this.
Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,

From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
From forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s wheels
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.
From off the battlements of yonder tower,
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.
Full half an hour.
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,
Gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.
Get you to bed; faith, you’ll be sick tomorrow
Give me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._]
Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling;
Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,
Give me my sin again.
Give me some present counsel, or behold
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Give me the letter, I will look on it.
Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
Give me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night.
Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.
Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear!
Go ask his name. If he be married,
Go before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
Go hence, good night, and here stands all your state:
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,
Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets.
Go then; for ’tis in vain
Go thither and with unattainted eye,
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
Go to, go to!
Go to; I say you shall.
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up.
Go with me to the vault.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Go, Nurse, go with her. We’ll to church tomorrow.
Go, begone.
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Go. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
God’s bread, it makes me mad!
God forbid! Where’s this girl? What, Juliet!
God gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
God in heaven bless her.
God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;
God pardon him. I do, with all my heart.
God pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?
God save the mark!—here on his manly breast.
God shield I should disturb devotion!—
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
Going to find a barefoot brother out,
Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.
Good heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will
Good heart, at what?
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Good morrow, cousin.
Good morrow, father.
Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest
Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow
Good night.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
Gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.
Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.

Ha! Let me see her. Out alas! She’s cold,
Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say death;
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,
Hang him, Jack. Come, we’ll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay
Hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
Hark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise,
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?
Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,
Hath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,
Hath death lain with thy bride. There she lies,
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
Hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face,
Have at thee, coward.
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.
Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Have they been merry! Which their keepers call
Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,
Have you deliver’d to her our decree?
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?
Have you importun’d him by any means?
Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
He’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be?
He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
He is a kinsman to the Montague.
He is wise,
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
He made you for a highway to my bed,
He ran this way, and leap’d this orchard wall:
He shall be endur’d.
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
He shift a trencher! He scrape a trencher!
He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Help, help! Call help.
Hence banished is banish’d from the world,
Hence from Verona art thou banished.
Hence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
Henceforward I am ever rul’d by you.
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this
Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff.
Her body sleeps in Capel’s monument,
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
Her eye discourses, I will answer it.
Her mother is the lady of the house,
Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;
Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard.
Here’s goodly gear!
Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:
Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?
Here’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary!
Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Here in my house do him disparagement.
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
Here in this city visiting the sick,
Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
Here sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
Here were the servants of your adversary
Herself pois’d with herself in either eye:
Hie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell.
Hie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo
Hie you to church. I must another way,
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
His son is thirty.
His son was but a ward two years ago.
Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent
Hold thy desperate hand.
Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, Nurse.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground;
Holy Franciscan Friar! Brother, ho!
Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,
Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
How canst thou try them so?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.
How long hath he been there?
How long is’t now since last yourself and I
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
How nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal
How now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?
How now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?
How now, who calls?
How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
How oft when men are at the point of death
How shall that faith return again to earth,
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,
How stands your disposition to be married?
How well my comfort is reviv’d by this.
How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
How? Turn thy back and run?
Howlings attends it. How hast thou the heart,
Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.
I’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
I’ll be a candle-holder and look on,
I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
I’ll call them back again to comfort me.
I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,
I’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,
I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,
I’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.
I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,
I’ll look to like, if looking liking move:
I’ll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts.
I’ll not endure him.
I’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone.
I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
I’ll play the housewife for this once.—What, ho!—
I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,
I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell.
I’ll to my rest.
I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.
I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.
I am aweary, give me leave awhile;
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I am hurt.
I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far
I am not I if there be such an I;
I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
I am the greatest, able to do least,
I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
I am too young, I pray you pardon me.’
I bade her come. What, lamb! What ladybird!
I bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
I charge thee in the Prince’s name obey.
I come from Lady Juliet.
I come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,
I conjure only but to raise up him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,
I could not send it,—here it is again,—
I dare not, sir;
I do beseech thee,—
I do beseech you sir, have patience.
I do bite my thumb, sir.
I do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,
I do defy thy conjuration,
I do protest I never injur’d thee,
I do remember an apothecary,—
I do remember well where I should be,
I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve
I dreamt a dream tonight.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—
I dreamt my master and another fought,
I drew to part them, in the instant came
I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,
I fear too early: for my mind misgives
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
I have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
I have it, and soundly too. Your houses!
I have more care to stay than will to go.
I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,
I have no joy of this contract tonight;
I have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.
I have.
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
I know not, sir.
I know not.
I married them; and their stol’n marriage day
I mean sir, in delay
I mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
I must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight.
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
I must needs wake you. Lady! Lady! Lady!
I must upfill this osier cage of ours
I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;
I nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
I pray thee chide me not, her I love now
I pray thee leave me to myself tonight;
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:
I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his
I promise you, but for your company,
I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,
I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
I say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.
I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
I should adventure for such merchandise.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
I speak no treason.
I stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves
I strike quickly, being moved.
I take thee at thy word.
I tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
I think it best you married with the County.
I think you are happy in this second match,
I thought all for the best.
I thought thy disposition better temper’d.
I wake before the time that Romeo
I warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.
I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,
I was your mother much upon these years
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
I will confess to you that I love him.
I will follow you.
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.
I will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.
I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
I will omit no opportunity
I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a
I will then give it you soundly.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,
I will, and know her mind early tomorrow;
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
I would I were thy bird.
I would have been abed an hour ago.
I would not for the wealth of all the town
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.
I would the fool were married to her grave.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
I, measuring his affections by my own,
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
If I departed not, and left him there.
If I did stay to look on his intents.
If I do so, it will be of more price,
If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
If ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
If ever you disturb our streets again,
If good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news
If he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.
If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
If my heart’s dear love,—
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.
If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
If, rather than to marry County Paris
Immediately we do exile him hence.
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,
In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
In half an hour she promised to return.
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage.
In love?
In man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
In my behalf; my reputation stain’d
In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;
In penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
In such a gorgeous palace.
In tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed
In this so sudden business.
In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;
In what I further shall intend to do,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Indeed I never shall be satisfied
Indeed I should have ask’d you that before.
Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
Is Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
Is but a little way above our heads,
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
Is death misterm’d. Calling death banished,
Is death to any he that utters them.
Is empty on the back of Montague,
Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
Is guilty of this lamentable chance?
Is he gone, and hath nothing?
Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all;
Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars!
Is it good-den?
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
Is my dear son with such sour company.
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
Is partly to behold my lady’s face,
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
Is she a Capulet?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
Is the day so young?
Is the law of our side if I say ay?
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that;
Is to himself—I will not say how true—
Is your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
It burneth in the Capels’ monument.
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
It did, it did; alas the day, it did.
It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,
It fits when such a villain is a guest:
It helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.
It is an honour that I dream not of.
It is enough I may but call her mine.
It is my lady, O it is my love!
It is my soul that calls upon my name.
It is my will; the which if thou respect,
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
It is supposed, the fair creature died,—
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,
It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
It rains downright.
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?
It were a grief so brief to part with thee.

Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
Language: English
Leap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Let’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift
Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?
Let me be ta’en, let me be put to death,
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Let two more summers wither in their pride
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
Life and these lips have long been separated.
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.
Like death when he shuts up the day of life.
Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,
Like softest music to attending ears.

Live here in heaven and may look on her,
Live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.
Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.
Look to the bak’d meats, good Angelica;
Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
Look, and thou shalt see.
Look, look! O heavy day!
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
Lucio and the lively Helena. _

Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
My back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.
My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My child is yet a stranger in the world,
My conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?
My daughter he hath wedded. I will die.
My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
My fan, Peter.
My father Capulet will have it so;
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—
My life were better ended by their hate
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
My lord and you were then at Mantua:
My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.
My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
My master’s.
My master knows not but I am gone hence,
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
My nyas?
My only love sprung from my only hate!
My poverty, but not my will consents.
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
My will to her consent is but a part;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
Myself condemned and myself excus’d.

Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.
Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,
Nay, I’ll conjure too.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,
Nay, good goose, bite not.
Nay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower.
Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast
Nay, that’s not so.
Ne’er saw her match since first the world begun.
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
Never was seen so black a day as this.
News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
No better term than this: Thou art a villain.
No better.
No coz, I rather weep.
No faith, no honesty in men. All perjur’d,
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something
No less, nay bigger. Women grow by men.
No matter. Get thee gone,
No money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel.
No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.
No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,
No truly, sir; not a penny.
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,
No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis
No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
No, for then we should be colliers.
No, madam; we have cull’d such necessaries
No, marry; I fear thee!
No, my good lord.
No, no. But all this did I know before.
No, not a whit. What! I have watch’d ere now
No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
No.
No.
None but for some, and yet all different.
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Nor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,
Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
Not I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans
Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;
Not a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.
Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.
Not half so big as a round little worm
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
Not in a grave
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is:
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.
Not to his father’s; I spoke with his man.
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Not yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day
Noting this penury, to myself I said,
Now God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.
Now I’ll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet,
Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joy
Now Romeo is belov’d, and loves again,
Now afore God, this reverend holy Friar,
Now by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,
Now by the stock and honour of my kin,
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Now must I to the monument alone.
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
Now, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?
Now, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again
Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
Now, fellow, what’s there?
Now, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
Nurse!—What should she do here?
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, Nurse, I say!
Nurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me.
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
Nurse.
Nurse?
O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;
O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,
O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;
O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,
O Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,
O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.
O God’s lady dear,
O God ye good-en!
O God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
O God! I have an ill-divining soul!
O God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?
O God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?
O Juliet, I already know thy grief;
O Lord, I could have stay’d here all the night
O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
O Romeo, that she were, O that she were
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.
O anything, of nothing first create!
O blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
O child! O child! My soul, and not my child,
O churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop
O comfortable Friar, where is my lord?
O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!
O cousin, cousin.
O day, O day, O day, O hateful day.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!
O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt.
O find him, give this ring to my true knight,
O heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
O here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,
O lamentable day!
O lamentable day!
O let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost
O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!
O me! This sight of death is as a bell
O me, O me! My child, my only life.
O musicians, because my heart itself plays ‘My heart is full’. O play
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
O noble Prince, I can discover all
O now be gone, more light and light it grows.
O pardon me for bringing these ill news,
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
O she’s rich in beauty, only poor
O shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!
O son, the night before thy wedding day
O speak again bright angel, for thou art
O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,
O sweet my mother, cast me not away,
O teach me how I should forget to think.
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
O the people in the street cry Romeo,
O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?
O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
O where is Romeo, saw you him today?
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day.
O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,
O woeful day, O woeful day.
O woful time!
O, I am fortune’s fool!
O, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful,
O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
O, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once.
O, by this count I shall be much in years
O, he’s a lovely gentleman.
O, he is even in my mistress’ case.
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
O, in this love, you love your child so ill
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
O, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,
O, she knew well
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
O, that she knew she were!
O, then I see that mad men have no ears.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:
O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
O, well-a-day that ever I was born.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
O, what more favour can I do to thee
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
Obey, and go with me, for thou must die.
Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
Of a despised life, clos’d in my breast
Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal
Of all my buried ancestors are pack’d,
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
Of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.
Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
Of disobedient opposition
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Of love?
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
Of my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d
Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
Of one I danc’d withal.
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.
Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve
Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.
Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight.
Of yonder knight?
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
On Thursday next be married to this County.
On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,
On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
One desperate grief cures with another’s languish:
One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
One of our order, to associate me,
One pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;
One that you love.
One who to put thee from thy heaviness,
One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
Or I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
Or bid me go into a new-made grave,
Or by the break of day disguis’d from hence.
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Or else beshrew them both.
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,
Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Or manage it to part these men with me.
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Or never after look me in the face.
Or save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
Or shall we on without apology?
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay.
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
Or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans.
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
Out of her favour where I am in love.
Out on her, hilding.
Out upon you! What a man are you?
Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!
Out.

Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
Shall have the chinks.
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.
Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.
Shalt with him hence.
Shame come to Romeo.
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
She’d be as swift in motion as a ball;
She’s dead, deceas’d, she’s dead; alack the day!
She’s not fourteen.
She’s not well married that lives married long,
She I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
She could have run and waddled all about;
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
She speaks.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
She was too good for me. But as I said,
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
She will endite him to some supper.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out
Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces;
Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;
Simon Catling?
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg’d!
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d.
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
So early walking did I see your son.
So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
So far from sounding and discovery,
So fearful were they of infection.
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
So many guests invite as here are writ.
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor.
So please you, let me now be left alone,
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
So smile the heavens upon this holy act
So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
So stumblest on my counsel?
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.
So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.
So thrive my soul,—
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
Soft! I will go along:
Soft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.
Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! My lady!
Some comfort, Nurse.
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask’d.
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,
Some misadventure.
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,
Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,
Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
Spare not for cost.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
Stand not amaz’d. The Prince will doom thee death
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.

Stay but a little, I will come again.
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,
Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
Stay, fellow; I can read.
Staying for thine to keep him company.
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!

Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.

Such as I love, and you among the store,
Such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st;
Sure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,
Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.
Sweet, so would I:
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.

Take all myself.
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
Taking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,
Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.
Tell me in sadness who is that you love?
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
Than thou went’st forth in lamentation.
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
That’s a certain text.
That’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow
That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies
That’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?
That ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’
That God had lent us but this only child;
That I have worn a visor, and could tell
That I might touch that cheek.
That I must love a loathed enemy.
That I reviv’d, and was an emperor.
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
That I will show you shining at this feast,
That I yet know not?
That Romeo should upon receipt thereof,
That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.
That all the world will be in love with night,
That almost freezes up the heat of life.
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,
That calls our person from our morning’s rest?
That cop’st with death himself to scape from it.
That dreamers often lie.
That ever I should live to see thee dead.
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
That fair for which love groan’d for and would die,
That gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,
That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
That he should hither come as this dire night
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
That idles in the wanton summer air
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
That in thy likeness thou appear to us.
That is because the traitor murderer lives.
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,
That is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
That late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul
That lets it hop a little from her hand,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.
That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
That murder’d me. I would forget it fain,
That murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,
That one short minute gives me in her sight.
That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;
That plats the manes of horses in the night;
That presses them, and learns them first to bear,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
That runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo
That same villain Romeo.
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
That she do give her sorrow so much sway;
That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
That thou consent to marry us today.
That thou expects not, nor I look’d not for.
That thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—
That unsubstantial death is amorous;
That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
That we have had no time to move our daughter.
That were some spite. My invocation
That westward rooteth from this city side,
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
That whiles Verona by that name is known,
That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;
That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!

The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,
The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;
The cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
The curfew bell hath rung, ’tis three o’clock.
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.
The date is out of such prolixity:
The day is broke, be wary, look about.
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
The day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,
The earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,
The fee simple! O simple!
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,
The fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.
The grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,
The ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
The hateful mansion.
The heads of the maids?
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;
The horrible conceit of death and night,
The lady stirs.
The lady widow of Utruvio;
The law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,
The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
The life of Tybalt.
The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
The most you sought was her promotion,
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
The obsequies that I for thee will keep,
The only son of your great enemy.
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
The other did not so.
The pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,
The slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
The tears have got small victory by that;
The time and my intents are savage-wild;
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
The unreasonable fury of a beast.
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
The what?
The which, if you with patient ears attend,
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
Their course of love, the tidings of her death.
Then as the manner of our country is,
Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,
Then dreams he of another benefice:
Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,
Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
Then love-devouring death do what he dare,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take.
Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,
Then will I give you the serving-creature.
Then will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. I will
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
There’s no trust,
There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
There is no world without Verona walls,
There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,
There lies that Tybalt.
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
There shall no figure at such rate be set
There stays a husband to make you a wife.
Therefore be patient, take no note of him,
Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,
Therefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.
Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,
Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
Therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,
These dead men’s tombs.
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,
These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
These violent delights have violent ends,
They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.
They are all forth: well, I will walk myself
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
They are free men but I am banished.
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
They have made worms’ meat of me.
They must take it in sense that feel it.
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,
This but begins the woe others must end.
This by his voice, should be a Montague.
This cannot anger him. ’Twould anger him
This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house
This day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;
This doth not so, for she divideth us.
This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,
This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,
This is as’t should be. Let me see the County.
This is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.
This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more
This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.
This is she,—
This is that banish’d haughty Montague
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile,
This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die.
This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,
This letter he early bid me give his father,
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
This may flies do, when I from this must fly.
This neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue
This night I hold an old accustom’d feast,
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
This shall determine that.
This torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.
This vault a feasting presence full of light.

This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline,
Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of
Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
Thou art uprous’d with some distemperature;
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
Thou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.
Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,
Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Thou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,
Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,
Thou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Thou shalt be loggerhead.—Good faith, ’tis day.
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
Thou talk’st of nothing.
Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.
Thou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d:
Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up.
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
Thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.
Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo.
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
Three Musicians.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;
Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg’d.
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.
Thy father or thy mother, nay or both,
Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
Thy lips are warm!
Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,
Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
Till holy church incorporate two in one.
Till she had laid it, and conjur’d it down;
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.
Title: Romeo and Juliet
To County Paris, to prepare him up
To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.
To Lammas-tide?
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
To an impatient child that hath new robes
To answer that, I should confess to you.
To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,
To be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth.
To be consorted with the humorous night.
To be to thee this night a torchbearer
To bear a poison, I would temper it,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.
To bid me trudge.
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
To catch my death with jauncing up and down.
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
To fetch a ladder by the which your love
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,
To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
To have her match’d, and having now provided
To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
To hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
To help me sort such needful ornaments
To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,
To know our farther pleasure in this case,
To lay one in, another out to have.
To lie discolour’d by this place of peace?
To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.
To lure this tassel-gentle back again.
To make confession and to be absolv’d.
To make me die with a restorative.
To mangle me with that word banished?
To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;
To meet her new beloved anywhere.
To merit bliss by making me despair.
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
To murder, murder our solemnity?
To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.
To our house.
To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,
To press before thy father to a grave?
To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.
To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,
To rid her from this second marriage,
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
To scorn at our solemnity this night.
To season love, that of it doth not taste.
To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
To see now how a jest shall come about.
To see thy son and heir more early down.
To seek him here that means not to be found.
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
To stop the inundation of her tears,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
To such a greeting. Villain am I none;
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
To this same place, to this same monument.
To turn your households’ rancour to pure love.
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
To you and your behests; and am enjoin’d
Together with the terror of the place,
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,
Tomorrow will I send.
Tonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Too familiar
Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
Towards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoner
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.
True, I talk of dreams,
True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to
Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn.
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
Turn from their office to black funeral:
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.
Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.
Tush, I will stir about,
Tush, thou art deceiv’d.
Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here.
Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:
Tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Two households, both alike in dignity,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,
Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
Tybalt?
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now
Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.
Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
Uneven is the course; I like it not.
Unfold the imagin’d happiness that both
Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
United States without permission and without paying copyright
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
Unplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you.
Unseemly woman in a seeming man,
Unto my cell.
Unto the rigour of severest law.
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes

Warm and new kill’d.
Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death
Was ever book containing such vile matter
Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Was woe enough, if it had ended there.
Wash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,
We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,
We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,
We’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.
We are undone, lady, we are undone.
We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys. Be brisk awhile, and
We cannot without circumstance descry.
We follow thee.
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
We met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,
We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.
We shall be short in our provision,
We still have known thee for a holy man.

Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.
Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
Welcome then.
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
Welcome, gentlemen, ladies that have their toes
Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox; go:
Well what was yours?
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death
Well, he may chance to do some good on her.
Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit
Well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a
Well, sir.
Well, think of marriage now: younger than you,
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.
Were in a mask?
Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
Were thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,
What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?
What’s he that now is going out of door?
What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
What’s this? What’s this?
What I have spoke; but farewell compliment.
What a pestilent knave is this same!
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
What fear is this which startles in our ears?
What further woe conspires against mine age?
What hast thou found?
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
What if it be a poison, which the Friar
What if this mixture do not work at all?
What is her burying grave, that is her womb:
What is her mother?
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
What is the matter?
What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?
What man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night
What mean these masterless and gory swords
What misadventure is so early up,
What must be shall be.
What noise is here?
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
What o’clock tomorrow
What said my man, when my betossed soul
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
What say’st thou, my dear Nurse?
What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
What say you, can you love the gentleman?
What says he of our marriage? What of that?
What shall I swear by?
What should it be that they so shriek abroad?
What simpleness is this.—I come, I come.
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?
What villain, madam?
What will you give us?
What wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
What wouldst thou have with me?
What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
What, art thou hurt?
What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
What, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again?
What, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to;
What, ho! Apothecary!
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:
What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now.
What, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
What, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile.
What?
Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof
When I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?
When King Cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.
When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they
When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
When presently through all thy veins shall run
When the devout religion of mine eye
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
When well apparell’d April on the heel
Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?
Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?
Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
Where for this many hundred years the bones
Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?
Where is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?
Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
Where is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon.
Where is she? And how doth she? And what says
Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest.
Where that same banish’d runagate doth live,
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
Where underneath the grove of sycamore
Wherefore storm you so?
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey
Which craves as desperate an execution
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
Which is as thin of substance as the air,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
Which modern lamentation might have mov’d?
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Which she hath prais’d him with above compare
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,
Which the commission of thy years and art
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
Which to the high topgallant of my joy
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
Which way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Which you mistaking offer up to joy.
Which you weep for.
Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,
Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all,
Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin.
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
Whipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.
Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.
Whither to supper?
Who bare my letter then to Romeo?
Who calls so loud?
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,
Who here hath lain this two days buried.
Who is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?
Who is it?
Who knocks so hard? Whence come you, what’s your will?
Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
Who raging with thy tears and they with them,
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty
Whose house?
Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows
Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Why ‘Heart’s ease’?
Why ‘silver sound’? Why ‘music with her silver sound’? What say you,
Why I descend into this bed of death
Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
Why dost thou stay?
Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,
Why how now, kinsman!
Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
Why such is love’s transgression.
Why, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up.
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Why, how now, Juliet?
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou
Why, lamb, why, lady, fie, you slug-abed!
Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!
Why, may one ask?
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.
Why, what is Tybalt?
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
Will I set up my everlasting rest;
Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.
Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
Will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?
Will you tell me that?
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.
Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;
With Romeo till I behold him—dead—
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
With Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour
With all the admired beauties of Verona.
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
With blood remov’d but little from her own?
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d
With instruments upon them fit to open
With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead
With open outcry toward our monument.
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.
With repetition of my Romeo’s name.
With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,
With tender Juliet match’d, is now not fair.
With this night’s revels; and expire the term
With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
Within the infant rind of this weak flower
Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
Within thy help and holy physic lies.
Without a sudden calm will overset
Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
Women may fall, when there’s no strength in men.
Would’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.
Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death.
Would through the airy region stream so bright
Ye say honestly, rest you merry!
Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.
Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger.
Yes, better, sir.
Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Yet banished? Hang up philosophy.
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.
You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!
You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,
You are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,
You are a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed?
You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
You are too hot.
You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
You kiss by the book.
You lie.
You must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time.
You say well.
You say you do not know the lady’s mind.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me
You shall have none ill, sir; for I’ll try if they can lick their
You tallow-face!
You will not then?
You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!
You, Capulet, shall go along with me,
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim
Young Romeo, is it?
Young son, it argues a distemper’d head
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,
Your high displeasure. All this uttered
Your lady’s love against some other maid
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Your love says like an honest gentleman,
Your mother.
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Your worship in that sense may call him man.

And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,
But Montague is bound as well as I,
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
As that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,
Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
But I will write again to Mantua,
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,
Of all my buried ancestors are pack’d,
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,
Most detestable death, by thee beguil’d,
Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,
And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,
No faith, no honesty in men. All perjur’d,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,
Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,
Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow’d,
Subtly hath minister’d to have me dead,
That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,
Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,
Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
Come cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Ay, let the County take you in your bed,
The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,
He made you for a highway to my bed,
Shall be the label to another deed,
O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,
Doting like me, and like me banished,
Is death misterm’d. Calling death banished,
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,
All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,
Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,

Noting this penury, to myself I said,
She was too good for me. But as I said,
Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
O child! O child! My soul, and not my child,
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,
Ha! Let me see her. Out alas! She’s cold,
For I will raise her statue in pure gold,
But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,
Hence banished is banish’d from the world,
My child is yet a stranger in the world,
That lets it hop a little from her hand,
On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,
The law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,
Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,
The which, if you with patient ears attend,
By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,

Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,
O blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,
And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
I’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
I do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,
Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
I do remember well where I should be,
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace,
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,

Come hither, cover’d with an antic face,
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face,

My master knows not but I am gone hence,
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,
Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,
That westward rooteth from this city side,
I do protest I never injur’d thee,
For by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,
Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,
And for thy name, which is no part of thee,
Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife,
To rid her from this second marriage,
And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,
And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,
The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
Piteous predicament. Even so lies she,
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,
That fair for which love groan’d for and would die,
Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,
Be not so long to speak. I long to die,
And these who, often drown’d, could never die,
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile,
O Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,
Thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,
One of our order, to associate me,
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
You, Capulet, shall go along with me,
But come young waverer, come go with me,
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
Murder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,
To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,

Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
And this shall free thee from this present shame,
Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,
As if that name,
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,
Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
If ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline,
Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,
’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,
No matter. Get thee gone,
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,
Such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
So please you, let me now be left alone,
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare,
But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,
As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,
Thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,
And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,
But I can give thee more,
Such as I love, and you among the store,
To know our farther pleasure in this case,
For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,
Hark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
He is wise,
But to himself so secret and so close,
Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,
Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse,
And may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,
An honour! Were not I thine only nurse,
Nor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
A villain that is hither come in spite,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
I’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,
His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Is empty on the back of Montague,
And why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,
‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,
Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,
Or bid me go into a new-made grave,
He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,
Where that same banish’d runagate doth live,
What, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,
Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,
Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
For this alliance may so happy prove,
Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,
Go thither and with unattainted eye,
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
That murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off,
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Being one too many by my weary self,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself,
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
That Romeo should upon receipt thereof,
We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,
I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,

She’s not well married that lives married long,
Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,
But like a misshaped and sullen wench,
To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,
I think you are happy in this second match,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
But now I see this one is one too much,
For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,
Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
Let me be ta’en, let me be put to death,
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,
This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,
Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,
Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Thy father or thy mother, nay or both,
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
Gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Seal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,
Here in this city visiting the sick,
Delay this marriage for a month, a week,
In penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,
For exile hath more terror in his look,
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,

Come, come with me, and we will make short work,
Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,
Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,

And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,
Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,
Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,
Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all,
To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,
Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,
Hence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,

And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,

Being in night, all this is but a dream,
O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Who raging with thy tears and they with them,
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
Therefore be patient, take no note of him,
Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,
And by and by my master drew on him,
To hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,

Romeo can,
Amen, amen, but come what sorrow can,
No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,
Proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,
Unseemly woman in a seeming man,
Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,
Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
Your love says like an honest gentleman,
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
And art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,
By my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
That murder’d me. I would forget it fain,
We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
Now Romeo is belov’d, and loves again,
If ever you disturb our streets again,
But to his foe suppos’d he must complain,
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,
Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Now by the stock and honour of my kin,
I’ll be a candle-holder and look on,
We shall be short in our provision,
I do defy thy conjuration,
The most you sought was her promotion,
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,
O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,
And Montague, come you this afternoon,
Monday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
I, measuring his affections by my own,
I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,
That whiles Verona by that name is known,
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
In what I further shall intend to do,
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
O the people in the street cry Romeo,
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
I bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,
And from my soul too,
Now by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,
And I, for winking at your discords too,
O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,
O shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
The obsequies that I for thee will keep,
If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,
Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Sure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,
What misadventure is so early up,
Come, Montague, for thou art early up,
A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,
That presses them, and learns them first to bear,
And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
O God’s lady dear,
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,
Now afore God, this reverend holy Friar,
    An old hare hoar,
    And an old hare hoar,
A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,
Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,
And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,
A Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Live here in heaven and may look on her,
This letter he early bid me give his father,
In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,
Thou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,
Doth not she think me an old murderer,
It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
From off the battlements of yonder tower,
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Which is as thin of substance as the air,
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
Marry, bachelor,
But he, his own affections’ counsellor,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
Is but a little way above our heads,
Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
These violent delights have violent ends,
Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
Conceit more rich in matter than in words,
This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
That gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hath death lain with thy bride. There she lies,
And what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,
O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,
Not I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,
And then will I be general of your woes,
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,
I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,
I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,
And needly will be rank’d with other griefs,
You are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,
Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,
On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Then as the manner of our country is,
Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,
O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,
Culling of simples, meagre were his looks,
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
There is no world without Verona walls,
With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,
Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,
True, I talk of dreams,
As will disperse itself through all the veins,
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
A gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,
And breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,
Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,
Environed with all these hideous fears,
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
To stop the inundation of her tears,
I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
But my true love is grown to such excess,
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
One who to put thee from thy heaviness,
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
Feeling so the loss,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,
O, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
Stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,
Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,
O pardon me for bringing these ill news,
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,
In tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
It is my will; the which if thou respect,
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,
And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,
Hath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,
Now I’ll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet,
Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,
Either be gone before the watch be set,
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
The County will be here with music straight,
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
The grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,
That all the world will be in love with night,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,
O find him, give this ring to my true knight,
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
with some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,
To bear a poison, I would temper it,
Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
 [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,
Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,
I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,
And where the worser is predominant,
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
And know their spring, their head, their true descent,
Many for many virtues excellent,
Examine every married lineament,
For though fond nature bids us all lament,
Each part depriv’d of supple government,
Her body sleeps in Capel’s monument,
Wash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,
By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,
What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,
Howlings attends it. How hast thou the heart,
A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,
And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,
Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,
This night I hold an old accustom’d feast,
That I will show you shining at this feast,
I am the greatest, able to do least,
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,
There’s no trust,
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
Going to find a barefoot brother out,
Tush, I will stir about,
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you,
Well, think of marriage now: younger than you,
And yet not proud. Mistress minion you,
Why ‘silver sound’? Why ‘music with her silver sound’? What say you,
Taking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,
Alas that love so gentle in his view,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,
Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
And if a man did need a poison now,
And fall upon the ground as I do now,
For even the day before she broke her brow,
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
We met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,
I tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,
Day, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,
I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,
Is your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,
Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
Hie you to church. I must another way,
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,
O sweet my mother, cast me not away,
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Go before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,
This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,
Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
I promise you, but for your company,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
The day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,
So far from sounding and discovery,
That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
But Romeo may not. More validity,
Away to heaven respective lenity,
Two households, both alike in dignity,
For beauty starv’d with her severity,
Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.
The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.

ESCALUS, Prince of Verona.
With all the admired beauties of Verona.
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
Fifth Act, at Mantua.
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
Poor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb.
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.
 Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.
Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg’d.
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask’d.
Both you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.
Despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d.
Warm and new kill’d.
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d.
From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.
I thought thy disposition better temper’d.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.
He shall be endur’d.
Myself condemned and myself excus’d.
Tush, thou art deceiv’d.
To make confession and to be absolv’d.
I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.
That ever I should live to see thee dead.
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
Stay, fellow; I can read.
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.
that he will sure run mad.

Scene V. Juliet’s Chamber; Juliet on the bed.
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
And on my life hath stol’n him home to bed.
More torches here! Come on then, let’s to bed.
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle-bed.
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.

Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.
They are free men but I am banished.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.
Romeo that kill’d him, he is banished.
But Romeo may not, he is banished.
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
Hence from Verona art thou banished.
And vice sometime’s by action dignified.
As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.
And with my child my joys are buried.
Who here hath lain this two days buried.
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.

A plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.
Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Life and these lips have long been separated.
soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
I strike quickly, being moved.
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
And all the better is it for the maid.
When King Cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
It did, it did; alas the day, it did.
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.
And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Hold thy desperate hand.
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
Can I demand.
[_Within._] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
This but begins the woe others must end.
Farewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
Tomorrow will I send.
We sucking on her natural bosom find.
You say you do not know the lady’s mind.
Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.
And soar with them above a common bound.
To seek him here that means not to be found.
Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.
In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food.
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
And stole into the covert of the wood.
Have at thee, coward.
Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard.
The ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
I would I were thy bird.
Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.
No, my good lord.
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
Monday, my lord.
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
I take thee at thy word.
Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
What must be shall be.
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.
By playing it to me with so sour a face.
Or never after look me in the face.
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.
Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.
And thou dismember’d with thine own defence.
Immediately we do exile him hence.
Shalt with him hence.
Or by the break of day disguis’d from hence.
I do beseech you sir, have patience.

And too soon marr’d are those so early made.

Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.
And I’ll believe thee.
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee.
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here’s drink! I drink to thee.
Because it is an enemy to thee.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.
We follow thee.

And all those twenty could but kill one life.

That almost freezes up the heat of life.
Like death when he shuts up the day of life.
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
O me, O me! My child, my only life.
A challenge, on my life.
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
Soft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
There stays a husband to make you a wife.
And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.
Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage.
Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
To bid me trudge.
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die.
My daughter he hath wedded. I will die.
And the rank poison of the old will die.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
Obey, and go with me, for thou must die.
That dreamers often lie.
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
You lie.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.
Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take.
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
What, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile.
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
Do not deny to him that you love me.
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
They have made worms’ meat of me.
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
Or manage it to part these men with me.
Up, sir, go with me.
therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.
What wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.
Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
Nurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me.
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
And his to me.
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.
Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
And this same needy man must sell it me.
I’ll call them back again to comfort me.

Ay me.
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.
For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
Belonging to a man. O be some other name.
With repetition of my Romeo’s name.
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
It is my soul that calls upon my name.
We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.
You must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time.
And joy comes well in such a needy time.
What simpleness is this.—I come, I come.
My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
For shame, bring Juliet forth, her lord is come.
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Thou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.
That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
It is enough I may but call her mine.
Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
By the hour of nine.
But new struck nine.
Till holy church incorporate two in one.
The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
We are undone, lady, we are undone.
In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
By urging me to fury. O be gone.
We’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.
Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
Therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.
Come let’s away, the strangers all are gone.
Go, begone.
I’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone.
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Now must I to the monument alone.
I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
I have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
Every good hap to you that chances here.
Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here.
And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.
Was woe enough, if it had ended there.
This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
If I departed not, and left him there.
Stop there, stop there.
No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.
To meet her new beloved anywhere.
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
But saying o’er what I have said before.
Indeed I should have ask’d you that before.
No, no. But all this did I know before.
To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
It helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
Then will I give you the serving-creature.
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
Some misadventure.
O, he is even in my mistress’ case.
For well you know this is a pitiful case.
Being the time the potion’s force should cease.
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.
I should adventure for such merchandise.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:
One desperate grief cures with another’s languish:
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
Turn from their office to black funeral:
He ran this way, and leap’d this orchard wall:
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:
Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox; go:
Over men’s noses as they lie asleep:
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
Poison hath residence, and medicine power:
Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is:
And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Driving back shadows over lowering hills:
Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
provided that:
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:
And what love can do, that dares love attempt:
It fits when such a villain is a guest:
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For this time all the rest depart away:
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
The date is out of such prolixity:
To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;
I am not I if there be such an I;
Look to the bak’d meats, good Angelica;
My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
The earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;
Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
That God had lent us but this only child;
The time and my intents are savage-wild;
Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;
And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;
This day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;
Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground;
Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;
See, where he comes. So please you step aside;
A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;
And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
I am aweary, give me leave awhile;
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
To such a greeting. Villain am I none;
My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;
A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;
That is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;
By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;
Thou art uprous’d with some distemperature;
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
And yet I wish but for the thing I have;
But to the earth some special good doth give;
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;
Cry but ‘Ah me!’ Pronounce but Love and dove;
And therefore have I little talk’d of love;
Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;
O Juliet, I already know thy grief;
By heaven I love thee better than myself;
Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
And in her best array bear her to church;
Killing that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;
One pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;
Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say death;
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
And we mean well in going to this mask;
Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all;
She’d be as swift in motion as a ball;
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;
In man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;
Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;
Digressing from the valour of a man;
A bears him like a portly gentleman;
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
Till she had laid it, and conjur’d it down;
The lady widow of Utruvio;
Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
My father Capulet will have it so;
What, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to;
That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;
As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear;
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;
’Tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir;
I dare not, sir;
God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;
Both by myself and many other friends;
Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces;
O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Citizens of Verona; several Men and Women, relations to both houses;
Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;
Farewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
And since that time it is eleven years;
’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers;
 Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
_Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
Be not her maid since she is envious;
That unsubstantial death is amorous;
For you and I are past our dancing days;
Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that;
The tears have got small victory by that;
By any other name would smell as sweet;
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;
I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
That plats the manes of horses in the night;
Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;
I pray thee leave me to myself tonight;
I have no joy of this contract tonight;
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
Upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;
Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;
  Is very good meat in Lent;
And see how one another lends content;
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;
My will to her consent is but a part;
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st;
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Will I set up my everlasting rest;
your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;
She could have run and waddled all about;
The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;
I will, and know her mind early tomorrow;
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
That she do give her sorrow so much sway;
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;
Why ‘Heart’s ease’?
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
Which modern lamentation might have mov’d?
Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?
Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?
Is Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
God gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Fie, fie! What, are you mad?
What should it be that they so shriek abroad?
Now, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?
You are a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed?
But banished to kill me? Banished?
To mangle me with that word banished?
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
How stands your disposition to be married?
O God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?
What hast thou found?
O God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
O comfortable Friar, where is my lord?
A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
Who calls so loud?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
He’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be?
To lie discolour’d by this place of peace?
‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?
‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
By whose direction found’st thou out this place?
What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?
Is guilty of this lamentable chance?
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
To Lammas-tide?
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
Shall I send to thee?
For what, I pray thee?
Have you deliver’d to her our decree?
But I pray, can you read anything you see?
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
What further woe conspires against mine age?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
carry no crotchets. I’ll re you, I’ll fa you. Do you note me?
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
What wouldst thou have with me?
A fair assembly. [_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come?
ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?
God pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?
For who is living, if those two are gone?
Nurse!—What should she do here?
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
What noise is here?
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
How long hath he been there?
Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?
Now, fellow, what’s there?
Now, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?
Nurse?
Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?
What say’st thou, my dear Nurse?
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Whose house?
To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
To press before thy father to a grave?
The slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?
Would’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
My conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?
Of love?
In love?
Tell me in sadness who is that you love?
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
How now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?
Is he gone, and hath nothing?
Simon Catling?
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Is the day so young?
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?
The cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?
Dost thou not laugh?
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Can vengeance be pursu’d further than death?
Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?
And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
out of breath?
Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?
May not one speak?
Prates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
Why, may one ask?
Were in a mask?
hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
So stumblest on my counsel?
What if this mixture do not work at all?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
Who knocks so hard? Whence come you, what’s your will?
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
What villain, madam?
Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
Come hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?
What say you, can you love the gentleman?
Is it good-den?
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
That’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?
You will not then?
What, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again?
O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?
Again in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
Will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
How? Turn thy back and run?
With blood remov’d but little from her own?
can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?
Because he married me before to Romeo?
Who bare my letter then to Romeo?
Where is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?
Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
Come, shall we go?
Which way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
How canst thou try them so?
Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
Wherefore storm you so?
And what to?
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
[_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?
Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?
News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
Come you to make confession to this father?
What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?
What is her mother?
And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?
Who is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?
Whither to supper?
What is the matter?
Romeo begin both with a letter?
Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?
Do you quarrel, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
What’s he that now is going out of door?
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
My nyas?
The heads of the maids?
Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?
What’s this? What’s this?
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
How now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?
But, soft, what day is this?
[_Aside._] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
How now, who calls?
Have you importun’d him by any means?
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?
What fear is this which startles in our ears?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?
Well what was yours?
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
And madly play with my forefathers’ joints?
What will you give us?
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
Can heaven be so envious?
O God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?
What?
Will you tell me that?
She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
What says he of our marriage? What of that?
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
The what?
Good heart, at what?
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
Why, how now, Juliet?
Is she a Capulet?
Of yonder knight?
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
When I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?
Young Romeo, is it?
Who is it?
But now my lord, what say you to my suit?
Tybalt?
Why, what is Tybalt?
That I yet know not?
Speakest thou from thy heart?
What, art thou hurt?
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
That calls our person from our morning’s rest?
Prates too! What say you, James Soundpost?
Out upon you! What a man are you?
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
Am I like such a fellow?
She I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?
Is the law of our side if I say ay?
O where is Romeo, saw you him today?
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
Why dost thou stay?
[_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?
Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
What shall I swear by?
Or shall we on without apology?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
ropery?
To murder, murder our solemnity?
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?

THE PROLOGUE
 Enter Chorus.
CHORUS.
Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
Whose misadventur’d piteous overthrows
Doth with their death bury their parents’ strife.
The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,
And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
The which, if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
 [_Exit._]
ACT I
SCENE I. A public place.
 Enter Sampson and Gregory armed with swords and bucklers.
SAMPSON.
Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.
GREGORY.
No, for then we should be colliers.
SAMPSON.
I mean, if we be in choler, we’ll draw.
GREGORY.
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o’ the collar.
SAMPSON.
I strike quickly, being moved.
GREGORY.
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
SAMPSON.
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
GREGORY.
To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand: therefore, if thou
art moved, thou runn’st away.
SAMPSON.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
GREGORY.
That shows thee a weak slave, for the weakest goes to the wall.
SAMPSON.
True, and therefore women, being the weaker vessels, are ever thrust to
the wall: therefore I will push Montague’s men from the wall, and
thrust his maids to the wall.
GREGORY.
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
SAMPSON.
’Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I have fought with the
men I will be civil with the maids, I will cut off their heads.
GREGORY.
The heads of the maids?
SAMPSON.
Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads; take it in what sense
thou wilt.
GREGORY.
They must take it in sense that feel it.
SAMPSON.
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and ’tis known I am a
pretty piece of flesh.
GREGORY.
’Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou hadst been poor John.
Draw thy tool; here comes of the house of Montagues.
 Enter Abram and Balthasar.
SAMPSON.
My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
GREGORY.
How? Turn thy back and run?
SAMPSON.
Fear me not.
GREGORY.
No, marry; I fear thee!
SAMPSON.
Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
GREGORY.
I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as they list.
SAMPSON.
Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to
them if they bear it.
ABRAM.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMPSON.
I do bite my thumb, sir.
ABRAM.
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
SAMPSON.
Is the law of our side if I say ay?
GREGORY.
No.
SAMPSON.
No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir; but I bite my thumb, sir.
GREGORY.
Do you quarrel, sir?
ABRAM.
Quarrel, sir? No, sir.
SAMPSON.
But if you do, sir, I am for you. I serve as good a man as you.
ABRAM.
No better.
SAMPSON.
Well, sir.
 Enter Benvolio.
GREGORY.
Say better; here comes one of my master’s kinsmen.
SAMPSON.
Yes, better, sir.
ABRAM.
You lie.
SAMPSON.
Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy washing blow.
 [_They fight._]
BENVOLIO.
Part, fools! put up your swords, you know not what you do.
 [_Beats down their swords._]
 Enter Tybalt.
TYBALT.
What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
Turn thee Benvolio, look upon thy death.
BENVOLIO.
I do but keep the peace, put up thy sword,
Or manage it to part these men with me.
TYBALT.
What, drawn, and talk of peace? I hate the word
As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
Have at thee, coward.
 [_They fight._]
 Enter three or four Citizens with clubs.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Clubs, bills and partisans! Strike! Beat them down!
Down with the Capulets! Down with the Montagues!
 Enter Capulet in his gown, and Lady Capulet.
CAPULET.
What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
LADY CAPULET.
A crutch, a crutch! Why call you for a sword?
CAPULET.
My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
 Enter Montague and his Lady Montague.
MONTAGUE.
Thou villain Capulet! Hold me not, let me go.
LADY MONTAGUE.
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe.
 Enter Prince Escalus, with Attendants.
PRINCE.
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,—
Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mistemper’d weapons to the ground
And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb’d the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona’s ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker’d with peace, to part your canker’d hate.
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time all the rest depart away:
You, Capulet, shall go along with me,
And Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our farther pleasure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgement-place.
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
 [_Exeunt Prince and Attendants; Capulet, Lady Capulet, Tybalt,
 Citizens and Servants._]
MONTAGUE.
Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
BENVOLIO.
Here were the servants of your adversary
And yours, close fighting ere I did approach.
I drew to part them, in the instant came
The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepar’d,
Which, as he breath’d defiance to my ears,
He swung about his head, and cut the winds,
Who nothing hurt withal, hiss’d him in scorn.
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
Came more and more, and fought on part and part,
Till the Prince came, who parted either part.
LADY MONTAGUE.
O where is Romeo, saw you him today?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
BENVOLIO.
Madam, an hour before the worshipp’d sun
Peer’d forth the golden window of the east,
A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad,
Where underneath the grove of sycamore
That westward rooteth from this city side,
So early walking did I see your son.
Towards him I made, but he was ware of me,
And stole into the covert of the wood.
I, measuring his affections by my own,
Which then most sought where most might not be found,
Being one too many by my weary self,
Pursu’d my humour, not pursuing his,
And gladly shunn’d who gladly fled from me.
MONTAGUE.
Many a morning hath he there been seen,
With tears augmenting the fresh morning’s dew,
Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
Should in the farthest east begin to draw
The shady curtains from Aurora’s bed,
Away from light steals home my heavy son,
And private in his chamber pens himself,
Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out
And makes himself an artificial night.
Black and portentous must this humour prove,
Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
BENVOLIO.
My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
MONTAGUE.
I neither know it nor can learn of him.
BENVOLIO.
Have you importun’d him by any means?
MONTAGUE.
Both by myself and many other friends;
But he, his own affections’ counsellor,
Is to himself—I will not say how true—
But to himself so secret and so close,
So far from sounding and discovery,
As is the bud bit with an envious worm
Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
We would as willingly give cure as know.
 Enter Romeo.
BENVOLIO.
See, where he comes. So please you step aside;
I’ll know his grievance or be much denied.
MONTAGUE.
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let’s away,
 [_Exeunt Montague and Lady Montague._]
BENVOLIO.
Good morrow, cousin.
ROMEO.
Is the day so young?
BENVOLIO.
But new struck nine.
ROMEO.
Ay me, sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
BENVOLIO.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo’s hours?
ROMEO.
Not having that which, having, makes them short.
BENVOLIO.
In love?
ROMEO.
Out.
BENVOLIO.
Of love?
ROMEO.
Out of her favour where I am in love.
BENVOLIO.
Alas that love so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.
ROMEO.
Alas that love, whose view is muffled still,
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here’s much to do with hate, but more with love:
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O anything, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?
BENVOLIO.
No coz, I rather weep.
ROMEO.
Good heart, at what?
BENVOLIO.
At thy good heart’s oppression.
ROMEO.
Why such is love’s transgression.
Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
Which thou wilt propagate to have it prest
With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown
Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs;
Being purg’d, a fire sparkling in lovers’ eyes;
Being vex’d, a sea nourish’d with lovers’ tears:
What is it else? A madness most discreet,
A choking gall, and a preserving sweet.
Farewell, my coz.
 [_Going._]
BENVOLIO.
Soft! I will go along:
And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
ROMEO.
Tut! I have lost myself; I am not here.
This is not Romeo, he’s some other where.
BENVOLIO.
Tell me in sadness who is that you love?
ROMEO.
What, shall I groan and tell thee?
BENVOLIO.
Groan! Why, no; but sadly tell me who.
ROMEO.
Bid a sick man in sadness make his will,
A word ill urg’d to one that is so ill.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
BENVOLIO.
I aim’d so near when I suppos’d you lov’d.
ROMEO.
A right good markman, and she’s fair I love.
BENVOLIO.
A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
ROMEO.
Well, in that hit you miss: she’ll not be hit
With Cupid’s arrow, she hath Dian’s wit;
And in strong proof of chastity well arm’d,
From love’s weak childish bow she lives uncharm’d.
She will not stay the siege of loving terms
Nor bide th’encounter of assailing eyes,
Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
O she’s rich in beauty, only poor
That when she dies, with beauty dies her store.
BENVOLIO.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
ROMEO.
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste;
For beauty starv’d with her severity,
Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
She is too fair, too wise; wisely too fair,
To merit bliss by making me despair.
She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
Do I live dead, that live to tell it now.
BENVOLIO.
Be rul’d by me, forget to think of her.
ROMEO.
O teach me how I should forget to think.
BENVOLIO.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
Examine other beauties.
ROMEO.
’Tis the way
To call hers, exquisite, in question more.
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies’ brows,
Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair;
He that is strucken blind cannot forget
The precious treasure of his eyesight lost.
Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
What doth her beauty serve but as a note
Where I may read who pass’d that passing fair?
Farewell, thou canst not teach me to forget.
BENVOLIO.
I’ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE II. A Street.
 Enter Capulet, Paris and Servant.
CAPULET.
But Montague is bound as well as I,
In penalty alike; and ’tis not hard, I think,
For men so old as we to keep the peace.
PARIS.
Of honourable reckoning are you both,
And pity ’tis you liv’d at odds so long.
But now my lord, what say you to my suit?
CAPULET.
But saying o’er what I have said before.
My child is yet a stranger in the world,
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years;
Let two more summers wither in their pride
Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
PARIS.
Younger than she are happy mothers made.
CAPULET.
And too soon marr’d are those so early made.
The earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she,
She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
My will to her consent is but a part;
And she agree, within her scope of choice
Lies my consent and fair according voice.
This night I hold an old accustom’d feast,
Whereto I have invited many a guest,
Such as I love, and you among the store,
One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
At my poor house look to behold this night
Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
When well apparell’d April on the heel
Of limping winter treads, even such delight
Among fresh female buds shall you this night
Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see,
And like her most whose merit most shall be:
Which, on more view of many, mine, being one,
May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
Come, go with me. Go, sirrah, trudge about
Through fair Verona; find those persons out
Whose names are written there, [_gives a paper_] and to them say,
My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
 [_Exeunt Capulet and Paris._]
SERVANT.
Find them out whose names are written here! It is written that the
shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last, the
fisher with his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am sent to
find those persons whose names are here writ, and can never find what
names the writing person hath here writ. I must to the learned. In good
time!
 Enter Benvolio and Romeo.
BENVOLIO.
Tut, man, one fire burns out another’s burning,
One pain is lessen’d by another’s anguish;
Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
One desperate grief cures with another’s languish:
Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
And the rank poison of the old will die.
ROMEO.
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that.
BENVOLIO.
For what, I pray thee?
ROMEO.
For your broken shin.
BENVOLIO.
Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
ROMEO.
Not mad, but bound more than a madman is:
Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
Whipp’d and tormented and—God-den, good fellow.
SERVANT.
God gi’ go-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
ROMEO.
Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
SERVANT.
Perhaps you have learned it without book.
But I pray, can you read anything you see?
ROMEO.
Ay, If I know the letters and the language.
SERVANT.
Ye say honestly, rest you merry!
ROMEO.
Stay, fellow; I can read.
 [_He reads the letter._]
_Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
County Anselmo and his beauteous sisters;
The lady widow of Utruvio;
Signior Placentio and his lovely nieces;
Mercutio and his brother Valentine;
Mine uncle Capulet, his wife, and daughters;
My fair niece Rosaline and Livia;
Signior Valentio and his cousin Tybalt;
Lucio and the lively Helena. _
A fair assembly. [_Gives back the paper_] Whither should they come?
SERVANT.
Up.
ROMEO.
Whither to supper?
SERVANT.
To our house.
ROMEO.
Whose house?
SERVANT.
My master’s.
ROMEO.
Indeed I should have ask’d you that before.
SERVANT.
Now I’ll tell you without asking. My master is the great rich Capulet,
and if you be not of the house of Montagues, I pray come and crush a
cup of wine. Rest you merry.
 [_Exit._]
BENVOLIO.
At this same ancient feast of Capulet’s
Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lov’st;
With all the admired beauties of Verona.
Go thither and with unattainted eye,
Compare her face with some that I shall show,
And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
ROMEO.
When the devout religion of mine eye
Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fire;
And these who, often drown’d, could never die,
Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars.
One fairer than my love? The all-seeing sun
Ne’er saw her match since first the world begun.
BENVOLIO.
Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
Herself pois’d with herself in either eye:
But in that crystal scales let there be weigh’d
Your lady’s love against some other maid
That I will show you shining at this feast,
And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
ROMEO.
I’ll go along, no such sight to be shown,
But to rejoice in splendour of my own.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE III. Room in Capulet’s House.
 Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.
LADY CAPULET.
Nurse, where’s my daughter? Call her forth to me.
NURSE.
Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
I bade her come. What, lamb! What ladybird!
God forbid! Where’s this girl? What, Juliet!
 Enter Juliet.
JULIET.
How now, who calls?
NURSE.
Your mother.
JULIET.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
LADY CAPULET.
This is the matter. Nurse, give leave awhile,
We must talk in secret. Nurse, come back again,
I have remember’d me, thou’s hear our counsel.
Thou knowest my daughter’s of a pretty age.
NURSE.
Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
LADY CAPULET.
She’s not fourteen.
NURSE.
I’ll lay fourteen of my teeth,
And yet, to my teen be it spoken, I have but four,
She is not fourteen. How long is it now
To Lammas-tide?
LADY CAPULET.
A fortnight and odd days.
NURSE.
Even or odd, of all days in the year,
Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
Susan and she,—God rest all Christian souls!—
Were of an age. Well, Susan is with God;
She was too good for me. But as I said,
On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;
That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
And she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,
Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;
My lord and you were then at Mantua:
Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,
When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
To see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!
Shake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,
To bid me trudge.
And since that time it is eleven years;
For then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood
She could have run and waddled all about;
For even the day before she broke her brow,
And then my husband,—God be with his soul!
A was a merry man,—took up the child:
‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,
The pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.
To see now how a jest shall come about.
I warrant, and I should live a thousand years,
I never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;
And, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’
LADY CAPULET.
Enough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.
NURSE.
Yes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,
To think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;
And yet I warrant it had upon it brow
A bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;
A perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.
‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
Wilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.
JULIET.
And stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.
NURSE.
Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e’er I nurs’d:
And I might live to see thee married once, I have my wish.
LADY CAPULET.
Marry, that marry is the very theme
I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
How stands your disposition to be married?
JULIET.
It is an honour that I dream not of.
NURSE.
An honour! Were not I thine only nurse,
I would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.
LADY CAPULET.
Well, think of marriage now: younger than you,
Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
Are made already mothers. By my count
I was your mother much upon these years
That you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;
The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
NURSE.
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man
As all the world—why he’s a man of wax.
LADY CAPULET.
Verona’s summer hath not such a flower.
NURSE.
Nay, he’s a flower, in faith a very flower.
LADY CAPULET.
What say you, can you love the gentleman?
This night you shall behold him at our feast;
Read o’er the volume of young Paris’ face,
And find delight writ there with beauty’s pen.
Examine every married lineament,
And see how one another lends content;
And what obscur’d in this fair volume lies,
Find written in the margent of his eyes.
This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
The fish lives in the sea; and ’tis much pride
For fair without the fair within to hide.
That book in many’s eyes doth share the glory,
That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
So shall you share all that he doth possess,
By having him, making yourself no less.
NURSE.
No less, nay bigger. Women grow by men.
LADY CAPULET.
Speak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?
JULIET.
I’ll look to like, if looking liking move:
But no more deep will I endart mine eye
Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
 Enter a Servant.
SERVANT.
Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady
asked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity.
I must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight.
LADY CAPULET.
We follow thee.
 [_Exit Servant._]
Juliet, the County stays.
NURSE.
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE IV. A Street.
 Enter Romeo, Mercutio, Benvolio, with five or six Maskers;
 Torch-bearers and others.
ROMEO.
What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
Or shall we on without apology?
BENVOLIO.
The date is out of such prolixity:
We’ll have no Cupid hoodwink’d with a scarf,
Bearing a Tartar’s painted bow of lath,
Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
After the prompter, for our entrance:
But let them measure us by what they will,
We’ll measure them a measure, and be gone.
ROMEO.
Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling;
Being but heavy I will bear the light.
MERCUTIO.
Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
ROMEO.
Not I, believe me, you have dancing shoes,
With nimble soles, I have a soul of lead
So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
MERCUTIO.
You are a lover, borrow Cupid’s wings,
And soar with them above a common bound.
ROMEO.
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.
Under love’s heavy burden do I sink.
MERCUTIO.
And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
ROMEO.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
Too rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.
MERCUTIO.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Give me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._]
A visor for a visor. What care I
What curious eye doth quote deformities?
Here are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.
BENVOLIO.
Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in
But every man betake him to his legs.
ROMEO.
A torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,
Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels;
For I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,
I’ll be a candle-holder and look on,
The game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.
MERCUTIO.
Tut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:
If thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire
Or save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest
Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.
ROMEO.
Nay, that’s not so.
MERCUTIO.
I mean sir, in delay
We waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.
Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
ROMEO.
And we mean well in going to this mask;
But ’tis no wit to go.
MERCUTIO.
Why, may one ask?
ROMEO.
I dreamt a dream tonight.
MERCUTIO.
And so did I.
ROMEO.
Well what was yours?
MERCUTIO.
That dreamers often lie.
ROMEO.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
MERCUTIO.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the fore-finger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Over men’s noses as they lie asleep:
Her waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;
The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;
Her traces, of the smallest spider’s web;
The collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;
Her whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm
Prick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:
Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;
O’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;
O’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;
O’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,
Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
Sometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,
Tickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,
Then dreams he of another benefice:
Sometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night;
And bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
That presses them, and learns them first to bear,
Making them women of good carriage:
This is she,—
ROMEO.
Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace,
Thou talk’st of nothing.
MERCUTIO.
True, I talk of dreams,
Which are the children of an idle brain,
Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
Which is as thin of substance as the air,
And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
And, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,
Turning his side to the dew-dropping south.
BENVOLIO.
This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
ROMEO.
I fear too early: for my mind misgives
Some consequence yet hanging in the stars,
Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
With this night’s revels; and expire the term
Of a despised life, clos’d in my breast
By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But he that hath the steerage of my course
Direct my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!
BENVOLIO.
Strike, drum.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE V. A Hall in Capulet’s House.
 Musicians waiting. Enter Servants.
FIRST SERVANT.
Where’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?
He shift a trencher! He scrape a trencher!
SECOND SERVANT.
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they
unwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing.
FIRST SERVANT.
Away with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the
plate. Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; and as thou loves me,
let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. Antony and Potpan!
SECOND SERVANT.
Ay, boy, ready.
FIRST SERVANT.
You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for, in the
great chamber.
SECOND SERVANT.
We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys. Be brisk awhile, and
the longer liver take all.
 [_Exeunt._]
 Enter Capulet, &c. with the Guests and Gentlewomen to the Maskers.
CAPULET.
Welcome, gentlemen, ladies that have their toes
Unplagu’d with corns will have a bout with you.
Ah my mistresses, which of you all
Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty,
She I’ll swear hath corns. Am I come near ye now?
Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
That I have worn a visor, and could tell
A whispering tale in a fair lady’s ear,
Such as would please; ’tis gone, ’tis gone, ’tis gone,
You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play.
A hall, a hall, give room! And foot it, girls.
 [_Music plays, and they dance._]
More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
Ah sirrah, this unlook’d-for sport comes well.
Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,
For you and I are past our dancing days;
How long is’t now since last yourself and I
Were in a mask?
CAPULET’S COUSIN.
By’r Lady, thirty years.
CAPULET.
What, man, ’tis not so much, ’tis not so much:
’Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio,
Come Pentecost as quickly as it will,
Some five and twenty years; and then we mask’d.
CAPULET’S COUSIN.
’Tis more, ’tis more, his son is elder, sir;
His son is thirty.
CAPULET.
Will you tell me that?
His son was but a ward two years ago.
ROMEO.
What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand
Of yonder knight?
SERVANT.
I know not, sir.
ROMEO.
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
As a rich jewel in an Ethiop’s ear;
Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows
As yonder lady o’er her fellows shows.
The measure done, I’ll watch her place of stand,
And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight!
For I ne’er saw true beauty till this night.
TYBALT.
This by his voice, should be a Montague.
Fetch me my rapier, boy. What, dares the slave
Come hither, cover’d with an antic face,
To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
Now by the stock and honour of my kin,
To strike him dead I hold it not a sin.
CAPULET.
Why how now, kinsman!
Wherefore storm you so?
TYBALT.
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe;
A villain that is hither come in spite,
To scorn at our solemnity this night.
CAPULET.
Young Romeo, is it?
TYBALT.
’Tis he, that villain Romeo.
CAPULET.
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone,
A bears him like a portly gentleman;
And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
To be a virtuous and well-govern’d youth.
I would not for the wealth of all the town
Here in my house do him disparagement.
Therefore be patient, take no note of him,
It is my will; the which if thou respect,
Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
TYBALT.
It fits when such a villain is a guest:
I’ll not endure him.
CAPULET.
He shall be endur’d.
What, goodman boy! I say he shall, go to;
Am I the master here, or you? Go to.
You’ll not endure him! God shall mend my soul,
You’ll make a mutiny among my guests!
You will set cock-a-hoop, you’ll be the man!
TYBALT.
Why, uncle, ’tis a shame.
CAPULET.
Go to, go to!
You are a saucy boy. Is’t so, indeed?
This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.
You must contrary me! Marry, ’tis time.
Well said, my hearts!—You are a princox; go:
Be quiet, or—More light, more light!—For shame!
I’ll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts.
TYBALT.
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall,
Now seeming sweet, convert to bitter gall.
 [_Exit._]
ROMEO.
[_To Juliet._] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this,
My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
JULIET.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
For saints have hands that pilgrims’ hands do touch,
And palm to palm is holy palmers’ kiss.
ROMEO.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
JULIET.
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
ROMEO.
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do:
They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
JULIET.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake.
ROMEO.
Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take.
Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg’d.
[_Kissing her._]
JULIET.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
ROMEO.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urg’d!
Give me my sin again.
JULIET.
You kiss by the book.
NURSE.
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
ROMEO.
What is her mother?
NURSE.
Marry, bachelor,
Her mother is the lady of the house,
And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous.
I nurs’d her daughter that you talk’d withal.
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
Shall have the chinks.
ROMEO.
Is she a Capulet?
O dear account! My life is my foe’s debt.
BENVOLIO.
Away, be gone; the sport is at the best.
ROMEO.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
CAPULET.
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone,
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
Is it e’en so? Why then, I thank you all;
I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
More torches here! Come on then, let’s to bed.
Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late,
I’ll to my rest.
 [_Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse._]
JULIET.
Come hither, Nurse. What is yond gentleman?
NURSE.
The son and heir of old Tiberio.
JULIET.
What’s he that now is going out of door?
NURSE.
Marry, that I think be young Petruchio.
JULIET.
What’s he that follows here, that would not dance?
NURSE.
I know not.
JULIET.
Go ask his name. If he be married,
My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
NURSE.
His name is Romeo, and a Montague,
The only son of your great enemy.
JULIET.
My only love sprung from my only hate!
Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
That I must love a loathed enemy.
NURSE.
What’s this? What’s this?
JULIET.
A rhyme I learn’d even now
Of one I danc’d withal.
 [_One calls within, ‘Juliet’._]
NURSE.
Anon, anon!
Come let’s away, the strangers all are gone.
 [_Exeunt._]
ACT II
 Enter Chorus.
CHORUS.
Now old desire doth in his deathbed lie,
And young affection gapes to be his heir;
That fair for which love groan’d for and would die,
With tender Juliet match’d, is now not fair.
Now Romeo is belov’d, and loves again,
Alike bewitched by the charm of looks;
But to his foe suppos’d he must complain,
And she steal love’s sweet bait from fearful hooks:
Being held a foe, he may not have access
To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
And she as much in love, her means much less
To meet her new beloved anywhere.
But passion lends them power, time means, to meet,
Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.
 [_Exit._]
SCENE I. An open place adjoining Capulet’s Garden.
 Enter Romeo.
ROMEO.
Can I go forward when my heart is here?
Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
 [_He climbs the wall and leaps down within it._]
 Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
BENVOLIO.
Romeo! My cousin Romeo! Romeo!
MERCUTIO.
He is wise,
And on my life hath stol’n him home to bed.
BENVOLIO.
He ran this way, and leap’d this orchard wall:
Call, good Mercutio.
MERCUTIO.
Nay, I’ll conjure too.
Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover!
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,
Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
Cry but ‘Ah me!’ Pronounce but Love and dove;
Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
One nickname for her purblind son and heir,
Young Abraham Cupid, he that shot so trim
When King Cophetua lov’d the beggar-maid.
He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
I conjure thee by Rosaline’s bright eyes,
By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
That in thy likeness thou appear to us.
BENVOLIO.
An if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
MERCUTIO.
This cannot anger him. ’Twould anger him
To raise a spirit in his mistress’ circle,
Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
Till she had laid it, and conjur’d it down;
That were some spite. My invocation
Is fair and honest, and, in his mistress’ name,
I conjure only but to raise up him.
BENVOLIO.
Come, he hath hid himself among these trees
To be consorted with the humorous night.
Blind is his love, and best befits the dark.
MERCUTIO.
If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
O Romeo, that she were, O that she were
An open-arse and thou a poperin pear!
Romeo, good night. I’ll to my truckle-bed.
This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
Come, shall we go?
BENVOLIO.
Go then; for ’tis in vain
To seek him here that means not to be found.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE II. Capulet’s Garden.
 Enter Romeo.
ROMEO.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
 Juliet appears above at a window.
But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun!
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou her maid art far more fair than she.
Be not her maid since she is envious;
Her vestal livery is but sick and green,
And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
It is my lady, O it is my love!
O, that she knew she were!
She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
Her eye discourses, I will answer it.
I am too bold, ’tis not to me she speaks.
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
Having some business, do entreat her eyes
To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
Would through the airy region stream so bright
That birds would sing and think it were not night.
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.
O that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek.
JULIET.
Ay me.
ROMEO.
She speaks.
O speak again bright angel, for thou art
As glorious to this night, being o’er my head,
As is a winged messenger of heaven
Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
When he bestrides the lazy-puffing clouds
And sails upon the bosom of the air.
JULIET.
O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.
ROMEO.
[_Aside._] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
JULIET.
’Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,
Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
Belonging to a man. O be some other name.
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose
By any other name would smell as sweet;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,
Retain that dear perfection which he owes
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
And for thy name, which is no part of thee,
Take all myself.
ROMEO.
I take thee at thy word.
Call me but love, and I’ll be new baptis’d;
Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
JULIET.
What man art thou that, thus bescreen’d in night
So stumblest on my counsel?
ROMEO.
By a name
I know not how to tell thee who I am:
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
Because it is an enemy to thee.
Had I it written, I would tear the word.
JULIET.
My ears have yet not drunk a hundred words
Of thy tongue’s utterance, yet I know the sound.
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague?
ROMEO.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
JULIET.
How cam’st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
And the place death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
ROMEO.
With love’s light wings did I o’erperch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out,
And what love can do, that dares love attempt:
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
JULIET.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
ROMEO.
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.
JULIET.
I would not for the world they saw thee here.
ROMEO.
I have night’s cloak to hide me from their eyes,
And but thou love me, let them find me here.
My life were better ended by their hate
Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
JULIET.
By whose direction found’st thou out this place?
ROMEO.
By love, that first did prompt me to enquire;
He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet wert thou as far
As that vast shore wash’d with the farthest sea,
I should adventure for such merchandise.
JULIET.
Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
What I have spoke; but farewell compliment.
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say Ay,
And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear’st,
Thou mayst prove false. At lovers’ perjuries,
They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly won,
I’ll frown and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond;
And therefore thou mayst think my ’haviour light:
But trust me, gentleman, I’ll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess,
But that thou overheard’st, ere I was ’ware,
My true-love passion; therefore pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night hath so discovered.
ROMEO.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops,—
JULIET.
O swear not by the moon, th’inconstant moon,
That monthly changes in her circled orb,
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
ROMEO.
What shall I swear by?
JULIET.
Do not swear at all.
Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I’ll believe thee.
ROMEO.
If my heart’s dear love,—
JULIET.
Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
I have no joy of this contract tonight;
It is too rash, too unadvis’d, too sudden,
Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
Ere one can say It lightens. Sweet, good night.
This bud of love, by summer’s ripening breath,
May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart as that within my breast.
ROMEO.
O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
JULIET.
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight?
ROMEO.
Th’exchange of thy love’s faithful vow for mine.
JULIET.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it;
And yet I would it were to give again.
ROMEO.
Would’st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love?
JULIET.
But to be frank and give it thee again.
And yet I wish but for the thing I have;
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have, for both are infinite.
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu.
[_Nurse calls within._]
Anon, good Nurse!—Sweet Montague be true.
Stay but a little, I will come again.
 [_Exit._]
ROMEO.
O blessed, blessed night. I am afeard,
Being in night, all this is but a dream,
Too flattering sweet to be substantial.
 Enter Juliet above.
JULIET.
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
If that thy bent of love be honourable,
Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow,
By one that I’ll procure to come to thee,
Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite,
And all my fortunes at thy foot I’ll lay
And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
NURSE.
[_Within._] Madam.
JULIET.
I come, anon.— But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee,—
NURSE.
[_Within._] Madam.
JULIET.
By and by I come—
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.
Tomorrow will I send.
ROMEO.
So thrive my soul,—
JULIET.
A thousand times good night.
 [_Exit._]
ROMEO.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books,
But love from love, towards school with heavy looks.
 [_Retiring slowly._]
 Re-enter Juliet, above.
JULIET.
Hist! Romeo, hist! O for a falconer’s voice
To lure this tassel-gentle back again.
Bondage is hoarse and may not speak aloud,
Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine
With repetition of my Romeo’s name.
ROMEO.
It is my soul that calls upon my name.
How silver-sweet sound lovers’ tongues by night,
Like softest music to attending ears.
JULIET.
Romeo.
ROMEO.
My nyas?
JULIET.
What o’clock tomorrow
Shall I send to thee?
ROMEO.
By the hour of nine.
JULIET.
I will not fail. ’Tis twenty years till then.
I have forgot why I did call thee back.
ROMEO.
Let me stand here till thou remember it.
JULIET.
I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
Remembering how I love thy company.
ROMEO.
And I’ll still stay, to have thee still forget,
Forgetting any other home but this.
JULIET.
’Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone,
And yet no farther than a wanton’s bird,
That lets it hop a little from her hand,
Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
So loving-jealous of his liberty.
ROMEO.
I would I were thy bird.
JULIET.
Sweet, so would I:
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow
That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
 [_Exit._]
ROMEO.
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast.
Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest.
The grey-ey’d morn smiles on the frowning night,
Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light;
And darkness fleckled like a drunkard reels
From forth day’s pathway, made by Titan’s wheels
Hence will I to my ghostly Sire’s cell,
His help to crave and my dear hap to tell.
 [_Exit._]
SCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.
 Enter Friar Lawrence with a basket.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
The day to cheer, and night’s dank dew to dry,
I must upfill this osier cage of ours
With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
The earth that’s nature’s mother, is her tomb;
What is her burying grave, that is her womb:
And from her womb children of divers kind
We sucking on her natural bosom find.
Many for many virtues excellent,
None but for some, and yet all different.
O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
In plants, herbs, stones, and their true qualities.
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live
But to the earth some special good doth give;
Nor aught so good but, strain’d from that fair use,
Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse.
Virtue itself turns vice being misapplied,
And vice sometime’s by action dignified.
 Enter Romeo.
Within the infant rind of this weak flower
Poison hath residence, and medicine power:
For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
Two such opposed kings encamp them still
In man as well as herbs,—grace and rude will;
And where the worser is predominant,
Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
ROMEO.
Good morrow, father.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Benedicite!
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
Young son, it argues a distemper’d head
So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed.
Care keeps his watch in every old man’s eye,
And where care lodges sleep will never lie;
But where unbruised youth with unstuff’d brain
Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign.
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
Thou art uprous’d with some distemperature;
Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight.
ROMEO.
That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
God pardon sin. Wast thou with Rosaline?
ROMEO.
With Rosaline, my ghostly father? No.
I have forgot that name, and that name’s woe.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
That’s my good son. But where hast thou been then?
ROMEO.
I’ll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
I have been feasting with mine enemy,
Where on a sudden one hath wounded me
That’s by me wounded. Both our remedies
Within thy help and holy physic lies.
I bear no hatred, blessed man; for lo,
My intercession likewise steads my foe.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
ROMEO.
Then plainly know my heart’s dear love is set
On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
And all combin’d, save what thou must combine
By holy marriage. When, and where, and how
We met, we woo’d, and made exchange of vow,
I’ll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
That thou consent to marry us today.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Holy Saint Francis! What a change is here!
Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear,
So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies
Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
Hath wash’d thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
How much salt water thrown away in waste,
To season love, that of it doth not taste.
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
Thy old groans yet ring in mine ancient ears.
Lo here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
Of an old tear that is not wash’d off yet.
If ere thou wast thyself, and these woes thine,
Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline,
And art thou chang’d? Pronounce this sentence then,
Women may fall, when there’s no strength in men.
ROMEO.
Thou chidd’st me oft for loving Rosaline.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
ROMEO.
And bad’st me bury love.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Not in a grave
To lay one in, another out to have.
ROMEO.
I pray thee chide me not, her I love now
Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
The other did not so.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
O, she knew well
Thy love did read by rote, that could not spell.
But come young waverer, come go with me,
In one respect I’ll thy assistant be;
For this alliance may so happy prove,
To turn your households’ rancour to pure love.
ROMEO.
O let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE IV. A Street.
 Enter Benvolio and Mercutio.
MERCUTIO.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?
BENVOLIO.
Not to his father’s; I spoke with his man.
MERCUTIO.
Why, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments him so
that he will sure run mad.
BENVOLIO.
Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a letter to his father’s
house.
MERCUTIO.
A challenge, on my life.
BENVOLIO.
Romeo will answer it.
MERCUTIO.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
BENVOLIO.
Nay, he will answer the letter’s master, how he dares, being dared.
MERCUTIO.
Alas poor Romeo, he is already dead, stabbed with a white wench’s black
eye; run through the ear with a love song, the very pin of his heart
cleft with the blind bow-boy’s butt-shaft. And is he a man to encounter
Tybalt?
BENVOLIO.
Why, what is Tybalt?
MERCUTIO.
More than Prince of cats. O, he’s the courageous captain of
compliments. He fights as you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance,
and proportion. He rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in
your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist;
a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause. Ah,
the immortal passado, the punto reverso, the hay.
BENVOLIO.
The what?
MERCUTIO.
The pox of such antic lisping, affecting phantasies; these new tuners
of accent. By Jesu, a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good
whore. Why, is not this a lamentable thing, grandsire, that we should
be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these fashion-mongers,
these pardon-me’s, who stand so much on the new form that they cannot
sit at ease on the old bench? O their bones, their bones!
 Enter Romeo.
BENVOLIO.
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo!
MERCUTIO.
Without his roe, like a dried herring. O flesh, flesh, how art thou
fishified! Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in. Laura, to
his lady, was but a kitchen wench,—marry, she had a better love to
berhyme her: Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gypsy; Helen and Hero hildings
and harlots; Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
Romeo, bonjour! There’s a French salutation to your French slop. You
gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
ROMEO.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
MERCUTIO.
The slip sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
ROMEO.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great, and in such a case as
mine a man may strain courtesy.
MERCUTIO.
That’s as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow
in the hams.
ROMEO.
Meaning, to curtsy.
MERCUTIO.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
ROMEO.
A most courteous exposition.
MERCUTIO.
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
ROMEO.
Pink for flower.
MERCUTIO.
Right.
ROMEO.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
MERCUTIO.
Sure wit, follow me this jest now, till thou hast worn out thy pump,
that when the single sole of it is worn, the jest may remain after the
wearing, solely singular.
ROMEO.
O single-soled jest, solely singular for the singleness!
MERCUTIO.
Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
ROMEO.
Swits and spurs, swits and spurs; or I’ll cry a match.
MERCUTIO.
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I am done. For thou hast
more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I am sure, I have in my
whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?
ROMEO.
Thou wast never with me for anything, when thou wast not there for the
goose.
MERCUTIO.
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
ROMEO.
Nay, good goose, bite not.
MERCUTIO.
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting, it is a most sharp sauce.
ROMEO.
And is it not then well served in to a sweet goose?
MERCUTIO.
O here’s a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an inch narrow to an
ell broad.
ROMEO.
I stretch it out for that word broad, which added to the goose, proves
thee far and wide a broad goose.
MERCUTIO.
Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou
sociable, now art thou Romeo; not art thou what thou art, by art as
well as by nature. For this drivelling love is like a great natural,
that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
BENVOLIO.
Stop there, stop there.
MERCUTIO.
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
BENVOLIO.
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
MERCUTIO.
O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short, for I was come to the
whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the argument no
longer.
 Enter Nurse and Peter.
ROMEO.
Here’s goodly gear!
A sail, a sail!
MERCUTIO.
Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
NURSE.
Peter!
PETER.
Anon.
NURSE.
My fan, Peter.
MERCUTIO.
Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan’s the fairer face.
NURSE.
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
MERCUTIO.
God ye good-den, fair gentlewoman.
NURSE.
Is it good-den?
MERCUTIO.
’Tis no less, I tell ye; for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the
prick of noon.
NURSE.
Out upon you! What a man are you?
ROMEO.
One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to mar.
NURSE.
By my troth, it is well said; for himself to mar, quoth a? Gentlemen,
can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo?
ROMEO.
I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you have found him
than he was when you sought him. I am the youngest of that name, for
fault of a worse.
NURSE.
You say well.
MERCUTIO.
Yea, is the worst well? Very well took, i’faith; wisely, wisely.
NURSE.
If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with you.
BENVOLIO.
She will endite him to some supper.
MERCUTIO.
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho!
ROMEO.
What hast thou found?
MERCUTIO.
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie, that is something
stale and hoar ere it be spent.
[_Sings._]
    An old hare hoar,
    And an old hare hoar,
  Is very good meat in Lent;
    But a hare that is hoar
    Is too much for a score
  When it hoars ere it be spent.
Romeo, will you come to your father’s? We’ll to dinner thither.
ROMEO.
I will follow you.
MERCUTIO.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, lady, lady, lady.
 [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]
NURSE.
I pray you, sir, what saucy merchant was this that was so full of his
ropery?
ROMEO.
A gentleman, Nurse, that loves to hear himself talk, and will speak
more in a minute than he will stand to in a month.
NURSE.
And a speak anything against me, I’ll take him down, and a were lustier
than he is, and twenty such Jacks. And if I cannot, I’ll find those
that shall. Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of
his skains-mates.—And thou must stand by too and suffer every knave to
use me at his pleasure!
PETER.
I saw no man use you at his pleasure; if I had, my weapon should
quickly have been out. I warrant you, I dare draw as soon as another
man, if I see occasion in a good quarrel, and the law on my side.
NURSE.
Now, afore God, I am so vexed that every part about me quivers. Scurvy
knave. Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told you, my young lady bid me
enquire you out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself. But first
let me tell ye, if ye should lead her in a fool’s paradise, as they
say, it were a very gross kind of behaviour, as they say; for the
gentlewoman is young. And therefore, if you should deal double with
her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, and
very weak dealing.
ROMEO. Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I protest unto
thee,—
NURSE.
Good heart, and i’faith I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she will
be a joyful woman.
ROMEO.
What wilt thou tell her, Nurse? Thou dost not mark me.
NURSE.
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which, as I take it, is a
gentlemanlike offer.
ROMEO.
Bid her devise
Some means to come to shrift this afternoon,
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence’ cell
Be shriv’d and married. Here is for thy pains.
NURSE.
No truly, sir; not a penny.
ROMEO.
Go to; I say you shall.
NURSE.
This afternoon, sir? Well, she shall be there.
ROMEO.
And stay, good Nurse, behind the abbey wall.
Within this hour my man shall be with thee,
And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair,
Which to the high topgallant of my joy
Must be my convoy in the secret night.
Farewell, be trusty, and I’ll quit thy pains;
Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
NURSE.
Now God in heaven bless thee. Hark you, sir.
ROMEO.
What say’st thou, my dear Nurse?
NURSE.
Is your man secret? Did you ne’er hear say,
Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
ROMEO.
I warrant thee my man’s as true as steel.
NURSE.
Well, sir, my mistress is the sweetest lady. Lord, Lord! When ’twas a
little prating thing,—O, there is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that
would fain lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a
toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her sometimes, and tell her that
Paris is the properer man, but I’ll warrant you, when I say so, she
looks as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not rosemary and
Romeo begin both with a letter?
ROMEO.
Ay, Nurse; what of that? Both with an R.
NURSE.
Ah, mocker! That’s the dog’s name. R is for the—no, I know it begins
with some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it,
of you and rosemary, that it would do you good to hear it.
ROMEO.
Commend me to thy lady.
NURSE.
Ay, a thousand times. Peter!
 [_Exit Romeo._]
PETER.
Anon.
NURSE.
Before and apace.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE V. Capulet’s Garden.
 Enter Juliet.
JULIET.
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse,
In half an hour she promised to return.
Perchance she cannot meet him. That’s not so.
O, she is lame. Love’s heralds should be thoughts,
Which ten times faster glides than the sun’s beams,
Driving back shadows over lowering hills:
Therefore do nimble-pinion’d doves draw love,
And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
Of this day’s journey, and from nine till twelve
Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
She’d be as swift in motion as a ball;
My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
And his to me.
But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
 Enter Nurse and Peter.
O God, she comes. O honey Nurse, what news?
Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
NURSE.
Peter, stay at the gate.
 [_Exit Peter._]
JULIET.
Now, good sweet Nurse,—O Lord, why look’st thou sad?
Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
If good, thou sham’st the music of sweet news
By playing it to me with so sour a face.
NURSE.
I am aweary, give me leave awhile;
Fie, how my bones ache! What a jaunt have I had!
JULIET.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
Nay come, I pray thee speak; good, good Nurse, speak.
NURSE.
Jesu, what haste? Can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am
out of breath?
JULIET.
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
To say to me that thou art out of breath?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that;
Say either, and I’ll stay the circumstance.
Let me be satisfied, is’t good or bad?
NURSE.
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man.
Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man’s, yet his
leg excels all men’s, and for a hand and a foot, and a body, though
they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He is not the
flower of courtesy, but I’ll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?
JULIET.
No, no. But all this did I know before.
What says he of our marriage? What of that?
NURSE.
Lord, how my head aches! What a head have I!
It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
My back o’ t’other side,—O my back, my back!
Beshrew your heart for sending me about
To catch my death with jauncing up and down.
JULIET.
I’faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
Sweet, sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me, what says my love?
NURSE.
Your love says like an honest gentleman,
And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome,
And I warrant a virtuous,—Where is your mother?
JULIET.
Where is my mother? Why, she is within.
Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest.
‘Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
‘Where is your mother?’
NURSE.
O God’s lady dear,
Are you so hot? Marry, come up, I trow.
Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
Henceforward do your messages yourself.
JULIET.
Here’s such a coil. Come, what says Romeo?
NURSE.
Have you got leave to go to shrift today?
JULIET.
I have.
NURSE.
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence’ cell;
There stays a husband to make you a wife.
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
They’ll be in scarlet straight at any news.
Hie you to church. I must another way,
To fetch a ladder by the which your love
Must climb a bird’s nest soon when it is dark.
I am the drudge, and toil in your delight;
But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
Go. I’ll to dinner; hie you to the cell.
JULIET.
Hie to high fortune! Honest Nurse, farewell.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE VI. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.
 Enter Friar Lawrence and Romeo.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
So smile the heavens upon this holy act
That after-hours with sorrow chide us not.
ROMEO.
Amen, amen, but come what sorrow can,
It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
That one short minute gives me in her sight.
Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
Then love-devouring death do what he dare,
It is enough I may but call her mine.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
These violent delights have violent ends,
And in their triumph die; like fire and powder,
Which as they kiss consume. The sweetest honey
Is loathsome in his own deliciousness,
And in the taste confounds the appetite.
Therefore love moderately: long love doth so;
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
 Enter Juliet.
Here comes the lady. O, so light a foot
Will ne’er wear out the everlasting flint.
A lover may bestride the gossamers
That idles in the wanton summer air
And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
JULIET.
Good even to my ghostly confessor.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
JULIET.
As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
ROMEO.
Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
Be heap’d like mine, and that thy skill be more
To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
This neighbour air, and let rich music’s tongue
Unfold the imagin’d happiness that both
Receive in either by this dear encounter.
JULIET.
Conceit more rich in matter than in words,
Brags of his substance, not of ornament.
They are but beggars that can count their worth;
But my true love is grown to such excess,
I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Come, come with me, and we will make short work,
For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
Till holy church incorporate two in one.
 [_Exeunt._]
ACT III
SCENE I. A public Place.
 Enter Mercutio, Benvolio, Page and Servants.
BENVOLIO.
I pray thee, good Mercutio, let’s retire:
The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
And if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl,
For now these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
MERCUTIO.
Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of
a tavern, claps me his sword upon the table, and says ‘God send me no
need of thee!’ and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the
drawer, when indeed there is no need.
BENVOLIO.
Am I like such a fellow?
MERCUTIO.
Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy; and as
soon moved to be moody, and as soon moody to be moved.
BENVOLIO.
And what to?
MERCUTIO.
Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for one would
kill the other. Thou? Why, thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a
hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast. Thou wilt quarrel
with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou
hast hazel eyes. What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy
head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling. Thou hast
quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street, because he hath
wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not fall
out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter? with
another for tying his new shoes with an old riband? And yet thou wilt
tutor me from quarrelling!
BENVOLIO.
And I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man should buy the fee
simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
MERCUTIO.
The fee simple! O simple!
 Enter Tybalt and others.
BENVOLIO.
By my head, here comes the Capulets.
MERCUTIO.
By my heel, I care not.
TYBALT.
Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
Gentlemen, good-den: a word with one of you.
MERCUTIO.
And but one word with one of us? Couple it with something; make it a
word and a blow.
TYBALT.
You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, and you will give me
occasion.
MERCUTIO.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
TYBALT.
Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
MERCUTIO.
Consort? What, dost thou make us minstrels? And thou make minstrels of
us, look to hear nothing but discords. Here’s my fiddlestick, here’s
that shall make you dance. Zounds, consort!
BENVOLIO.
We talk here in the public haunt of men.
Either withdraw unto some private place,
And reason coldly of your grievances,
Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
MERCUTIO.
Men’s eyes were made to look, and let them gaze.
I will not budge for no man’s pleasure, I.
 Enter Romeo.
TYBALT.
Well, peace be with you, sir, here comes my man.
MERCUTIO.
But I’ll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery.
Marry, go before to field, he’ll be your follower;
Your worship in that sense may call him man.
TYBALT.
Romeo, the love I bear thee can afford
No better term than this: Thou art a villain.
ROMEO.
Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
To such a greeting. Villain am I none;
Therefore farewell; I see thou know’st me not.
TYBALT.
Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
That thou hast done me, therefore turn and draw.
ROMEO.
I do protest I never injur’d thee,
But love thee better than thou canst devise
Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.
And so good Capulet, which name I tender
As dearly as mine own, be satisfied.
MERCUTIO.
O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
[_Draws._] Alla stoccata carries it away.
Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
TYBALT.
What wouldst thou have with me?
MERCUTIO.
Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine lives; that I mean to
make bold withal, and, as you shall use me hereafter, dry-beat the rest
of the eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears?
Make haste, lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.
TYBALT.
[_Drawing._] I am for you.
ROMEO.
Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
MERCUTIO.
Come, sir, your passado.
 [_They fight._]
ROMEO.
Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage,
Tybalt, Mercutio, the Prince expressly hath
Forbid this bandying in Verona streets.
Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!
 [_Exeunt Tybalt with his Partizans._]
MERCUTIO.
I am hurt.
A plague o’ both your houses. I am sped.
Is he gone, and hath nothing?
BENVOLIO.
What, art thou hurt?
MERCUTIO.
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Marry, ’tis enough.
Where is my page? Go villain, fetch a surgeon.
 [_Exit Page._]
ROMEO.
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
MERCUTIO.
No, ’tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a church door, but ’tis
enough, ’twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a
grave man. I am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o’ both
your houses. Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a cat, to scratch a man to
death. A braggart, a rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
arithmetic!—Why the devil came you between us? I was hurt under your
arm.
ROMEO.
I thought all for the best.
MERCUTIO.
Help me into some house, Benvolio,
Or I shall faint. A plague o’ both your houses.
They have made worms’ meat of me.
I have it, and soundly too. Your houses!
 [_Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio._]
ROMEO.
This gentleman, the Prince’s near ally,
My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
In my behalf; my reputation stain’d
With Tybalt’s slander,—Tybalt, that an hour
Hath been my cousin. O sweet Juliet,
Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
And in my temper soften’d valour’s steel.
 Re-enter Benvolio.
BENVOLIO.
O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio’s dead,
That gallant spirit hath aspir’d the clouds,
Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
ROMEO.
This day’s black fate on mo days doth depend;
This but begins the woe others must end.
 Re-enter Tybalt.
BENVOLIO.
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
ROMEO.
Again in triumph, and Mercutio slain?
Away to heaven respective lenity,
And fire-ey’d fury be my conduct now!
Now, Tybalt, take the ‘villain’ back again
That late thou gav’st me, for Mercutio’s soul
Is but a little way above our heads,
Staying for thine to keep him company.
Either thou or I, or both, must go with him.
TYBALT.
Thou wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
Shalt with him hence.
ROMEO.
This shall determine that.
 [_They fight; Tybalt falls._]
BENVOLIO.
Romeo, away, be gone!
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
Stand not amaz’d. The Prince will doom thee death
If thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!
ROMEO.
O, I am fortune’s fool!
BENVOLIO.
Why dost thou stay?
 [_Exit Romeo._]
 Enter Citizens.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Which way ran he that kill’d Mercutio?
Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
BENVOLIO.
There lies that Tybalt.
FIRST CITIZEN.
Up, sir, go with me.
I charge thee in the Prince’s name obey.
 Enter Prince, attended; Montague, Capulet, their Wives and others.
PRINCE.
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
BENVOLIO.
O noble Prince, I can discover all
The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl.
There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
LADY CAPULET.
Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother’s child!
O Prince! O husband! O, the blood is spill’d
Of my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
For blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
O cousin, cousin.
PRINCE.
Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
BENVOLIO.
Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo’s hand did slay;
Romeo, that spoke him fair, bid him bethink
How nice the quarrel was, and urg’d withal
Your high displeasure. All this uttered
With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow’d
Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, but that he tilts
With piercing steel at bold Mercutio’s breast,
Who, all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
Cold death aside, and with the other sends
It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
Retorts it. Romeo he cries aloud,
‘Hold, friends! Friends, part!’ and swifter than his tongue,
His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
And ’twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.
But by and by comes back to Romeo,
Who had but newly entertain’d revenge,
And to’t they go like lightning; for, ere I
Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain;
And as he fell did Romeo turn and fly.
This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
LADY CAPULET.
He is a kinsman to the Montague.
Affection makes him false, he speaks not true.
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
And all those twenty could but kill one life.
I beg for justice, which thou, Prince, must give;
Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
PRINCE.
Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio.
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
MONTAGUE.
Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio’s friend;
His fault concludes but what the law should end,
The life of Tybalt.
PRINCE.
And for that offence
Immediately we do exile him hence.
I have an interest in your hate’s proceeding,
My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.
But I’ll amerce you with so strong a fine
That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses.
Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste,
Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
Bear hence this body, and attend our will.
Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE II. A Room in Capulet’s House.
 Enter Juliet.
JULIET.
Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
Towards Phoebus’ lodging. Such a waggoner
As Phaeton would whip you to the west
And bring in cloudy night immediately.
Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
That runaway’s eyes may wink, and Romeo
Leap to these arms, untalk’d of and unseen.
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
By their own beauties: or, if love be blind,
It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
And learn me how to lose a winning match,
Play’d for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.
Hood my unmann’d blood, bating in my cheeks,
With thy black mantle, till strange love, grow bold,
Think true love acted simple modesty.
Come, night, come Romeo; come, thou day in night;
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
Whiter than new snow upon a raven’s back.
Come gentle night, come loving black-brow’d night,
Give me my Romeo, and when I shall die,
Take him and cut him out in little stars,
And he will make the face of heaven so fine
That all the world will be in love with night,
And pay no worship to the garish sun.
O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
But not possess’d it; and though I am sold,
Not yet enjoy’d. So tedious is this day
As is the night before some festival
To an impatient child that hath new robes
And may not wear them. O, here comes my Nurse,
And she brings news, and every tongue that speaks
But Romeo’s name speaks heavenly eloquence.
 Enter Nurse, with cords.
Now, Nurse, what news? What hast thou there?
The cords that Romeo bid thee fetch?
NURSE.
Ay, ay, the cords.
 [_Throws them down._]
JULIET.
Ay me, what news? Why dost thou wring thy hands?
NURSE.
Ah, well-a-day, he’s dead, he’s dead, he’s dead!
We are undone, lady, we are undone.
Alack the day, he’s gone, he’s kill’d, he’s dead.
JULIET.
Can heaven be so envious?
NURSE.
Romeo can,
Though heaven cannot. O Romeo, Romeo.
Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
JULIET.
What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
This torture should be roar’d in dismal hell.
Hath Romeo slain himself? Say thou but Ay,
And that bare vowel I shall poison more
Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice.
I am not I if there be such an I;
Or those eyes shut that make thee answer Ay.
If he be slain, say Ay; or if not, No.
Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
NURSE.
I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,
God save the mark!—here on his manly breast.
A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub’d in blood,
All in gore-blood. I swounded at the sight.
JULIET.
O, break, my heart. Poor bankrout, break at once.
To prison, eyes; ne’er look on liberty.
Vile earth to earth resign; end motion here,
And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier.
NURSE.
O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had.
O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman!
That ever I should live to see thee dead.
JULIET.
What storm is this that blows so contrary?
Is Romeo slaughter’d and is Tybalt dead?
My dearest cousin, and my dearer lord?
Then dreadful trumpet sound the general doom,
For who is living, if those two are gone?
NURSE.
Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished,
Romeo that kill’d him, he is banished.
JULIET.
O God! Did Romeo’s hand shed Tybalt’s blood?
NURSE.
It did, it did; alas the day, it did.
JULIET.
O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
Beautiful tyrant, fiend angelical,
Dove-feather’d raven, wolvish-ravening lamb!
Despised substance of divinest show!
Just opposite to what thou justly seem’st,
A damned saint, an honourable villain!
O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell
When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
In mortal paradise of such sweet flesh?
Was ever book containing such vile matter
So fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell
In such a gorgeous palace.
NURSE.
There’s no trust,
No faith, no honesty in men. All perjur’d,
All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
Ah, where’s my man? Give me some aqua vitae.
These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
Shame come to Romeo.
JULIET.
Blister’d be thy tongue
For such a wish! He was not born to shame.
Upon his brow shame is asham’d to sit;
For ’tis a throne where honour may be crown’d
Sole monarch of the universal earth.
O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
NURSE.
Will you speak well of him that kill’d your cousin?
JULIET.
Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
When I thy three-hours’ wife have mangled it?
But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
That villain cousin would have kill’d my husband.
Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring,
Your tributary drops belong to woe,
Which you mistaking offer up to joy.
My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain,
And Tybalt’s dead, that would have slain my husband.
All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
Some word there was, worser than Tybalt’s death,
That murder’d me. I would forget it fain,
But O, it presses to my memory
Like damned guilty deeds to sinners’ minds.
Tybalt is dead, and Romeo banished.
That ‘banished,’ that one word ‘banished,’
Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt’s death
Was woe enough, if it had ended there.
Or if sour woe delights in fellowship,
And needly will be rank’d with other griefs,
Why follow’d not, when she said Tybalt’s dead,
Thy father or thy mother, nay or both,
Which modern lamentation might have mov’d?
But with a rear-ward following Tybalt’s death,
‘Romeo is banished’—to speak that word
Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
All slain, all dead. Romeo is banished,
There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
In that word’s death, no words can that woe sound.
Where is my father and my mother, Nurse?
NURSE.
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt’s corse.
Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
JULIET.
Wash they his wounds with tears. Mine shall be spent,
When theirs are dry, for Romeo’s banishment.
Take up those cords. Poor ropes, you are beguil’d,
Both you and I; for Romeo is exil’d.
He made you for a highway to my bed,
But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
Come cords, come Nurse, I’ll to my wedding bed,
And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead.
NURSE.
Hie to your chamber. I’ll find Romeo
To comfort you. I wot well where he is.
Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night.
I’ll to him, he is hid at Lawrence’ cell.
JULIET.
O find him, give this ring to my true knight,
And bid him come to take his last farewell.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE III. Friar Lawrence’s cell.
 Enter Friar Lawrence.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
Affliction is enanmour’d of thy parts
And thou art wedded to calamity.
 Enter Romeo.
ROMEO.
Father, what news? What is the Prince’s doom?
What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
That I yet know not?
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Too familiar
Is my dear son with such sour company.
I bring thee tidings of the Prince’s doom.
ROMEO.
What less than doomsday is the Prince’s doom?
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
A gentler judgment vanish’d from his lips,
Not body’s death, but body’s banishment.
ROMEO.
Ha, banishment? Be merciful, say death;
For exile hath more terror in his look,
Much more than death. Do not say banishment.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hence from Verona art thou banished.
Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
ROMEO.
There is no world without Verona walls,
But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
Hence banished is banish’d from the world,
And world’s exile is death. Then banished
Is death misterm’d. Calling death banished,
Thou cutt’st my head off with a golden axe,
And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
O deadly sin, O rude unthankfulness!
Thy fault our law calls death, but the kind Prince,
Taking thy part, hath brush’d aside the law,
And turn’d that black word death to banishment.
This is dear mercy, and thou see’st it not.
ROMEO.
’Tis torture, and not mercy. Heaven is here
Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,
And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
Live here in heaven and may look on her,
But Romeo may not. More validity,
More honourable state, more courtship lives
In carrion flies than Romeo. They may seize
On the white wonder of dear Juliet’s hand,
And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
Who, even in pure and vestal modesty
Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin.
But Romeo may not, he is banished.
This may flies do, when I from this must fly.
They are free men but I am banished.
And say’st thou yet that exile is not death?
Hadst thou no poison mix’d, no sharp-ground knife,
No sudden mean of death, though ne’er so mean,
But banished to kill me? Banished?
O Friar, the damned use that word in hell.
Howlings attends it. How hast thou the heart,
Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
A sin-absolver, and my friend profess’d,
To mangle me with that word banished?
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Thou fond mad man, hear me speak a little,
ROMEO.
O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
I’ll give thee armour to keep off that word,
Adversity’s sweet milk, philosophy,
To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
ROMEO.
Yet banished? Hang up philosophy.
Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
Displant a town, reverse a Prince’s doom,
It helps not, it prevails not, talk no more.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
O, then I see that mad men have no ears.
ROMEO.
How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
ROMEO.
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
Doting like me, and like me banished,
Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
And fall upon the ground as I do now,
Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
 [_Knocking within._]
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Arise; one knocks. Good Romeo, hide thyself.
ROMEO.
Not I, unless the breath of heartsick groans
Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes.
 [_Knocking._]
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hark, how they knock!—Who’s there?—Romeo, arise,
Thou wilt be taken.—Stay awhile.—Stand up.
 [_Knocking._]
Run to my study.—By-and-by.—God’s will,
What simpleness is this.—I come, I come.
 [_Knocking._]
Who knocks so hard? Whence come you, what’s your will?
NURSE.
[_Within._] Let me come in, and you shall know my errand.
I come from Lady Juliet.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Welcome then.
 Enter Nurse.
NURSE.
O holy Friar, O, tell me, holy Friar,
Where is my lady’s lord, where’s Romeo?
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
NURSE.
O, he is even in my mistress’ case.
Just in her case! O woeful sympathy!
Piteous predicament. Even so lies she,
Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man.
For Juliet’s sake, for her sake, rise and stand.
Why should you fall into so deep an O?
ROMEO.
Nurse.
NURSE.
Ah sir, ah sir, death’s the end of all.
ROMEO.
Spakest thou of Juliet? How is it with her?
Doth not she think me an old murderer,
Now I have stain’d the childhood of our joy
With blood remov’d but little from her own?
Where is she? And how doth she? And what says
My conceal’d lady to our cancell’d love?
NURSE.
O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
And now falls on her bed, and then starts up,
And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries,
And then down falls again.
ROMEO.
As if that name,
Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
Did murder her, as that name’s cursed hand
Murder’d her kinsman. O, tell me, Friar, tell me,
In what vile part of this anatomy
Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sack
The hateful mansion.
 [_Drawing his sword._]
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hold thy desperate hand.
Art thou a man? Thy form cries out thou art.
Thy tears are womanish, thy wild acts denote
The unreasonable fury of a beast.
Unseemly woman in a seeming man,
And ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
Thou hast amaz’d me. By my holy order,
I thought thy disposition better temper’d.
Hast thou slain Tybalt? Wilt thou slay thyself?
And slay thy lady, that in thy life lives,
By doing damned hate upon thyself?
Why rail’st thou on thy birth, the heaven and earth?
Since birth, and heaven and earth, all three do meet
In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
Fie, fie, thou sham’st thy shape, thy love, thy wit,
Which, like a usurer, abound’st in all,
And usest none in that true use indeed
Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit.
Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
Digressing from the valour of a man;
Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
Killing that love which thou hast vow’d to cherish;
Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
Like powder in a skilless soldier’s flask,
Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
And thou dismember’d with thine own defence.
What, rouse thee, man. Thy Juliet is alive,
For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead.
There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee,
But thou slew’st Tybalt; there art thou happy.
The law that threaten’d death becomes thy friend,
And turns it to exile; there art thou happy.
A pack of blessings light upon thy back;
Happiness courts thee in her best array;
But like a misshaped and sullen wench,
Thou putt’st up thy Fortune and thy love.
Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
Go, get thee to thy love as was decreed,
Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
Where thou shalt live till we can find a time
To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
Beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee back
With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
Than thou went’st forth in lamentation.
Go before, Nurse. Commend me to thy lady,
And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto.
Romeo is coming.
NURSE.
O Lord, I could have stay’d here all the night
To hear good counsel. O, what learning is!
My lord, I’ll tell my lady you will come.
ROMEO.
Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
NURSE.
Here sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir.
Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
 [_Exit._]
ROMEO.
How well my comfort is reviv’d by this.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Go hence, good night, and here stands all your state:
Either be gone before the watch be set,
Or by the break of day disguis’d from hence.
Sojourn in Mantua. I’ll find out your man,
And he shall signify from time to time
Every good hap to you that chances here.
Give me thy hand; ’tis late; farewell; good night.
ROMEO.
But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
It were a grief so brief to part with thee.
Farewell.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE IV. A Room in Capulet’s House.
 Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and Paris.
CAPULET.
Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily
That we have had no time to move our daughter.
Look you, she lov’d her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
And so did I. Well, we were born to die.
’Tis very late; she’ll not come down tonight.
I promise you, but for your company,
I would have been abed an hour ago.
PARIS.
These times of woe afford no tune to woo.
Madam, good night. Commend me to your daughter.
LADY CAPULET.
I will, and know her mind early tomorrow;
Tonight she’s mew’d up to her heaviness.
CAPULET.
Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
Of my child’s love. I think she will be rul’d
In all respects by me; nay more, I doubt it not.
Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed,
Acquaint her here of my son Paris’ love,
And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next,
But, soft, what day is this?
PARIS.
Monday, my lord.
CAPULET.
Monday! Ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
A Thursday let it be; a Thursday, tell her,
She shall be married to this noble earl.
Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
We’ll keep no great ado,—a friend or two,
For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
It may be thought we held him carelessly,
Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
Therefore we’ll have some half a dozen friends,
And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
PARIS.
My lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.
CAPULET.
Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then.
Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.
Farewell, my lord.—Light to my chamber, ho!
Afore me, it is so very very late that we
May call it early by and by. Good night.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE V. An open Gallery to Juliet’s Chamber, overlooking the Garden.
 Enter Romeo and Juliet.
JULIET.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
That pierc’d the fearful hollow of thine ear;
Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
ROMEO.
It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks
Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day
Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
JULIET.
Yond light is not daylight, I know it, I.
It is some meteor that the sun exhales
To be to thee this night a torchbearer
And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
Therefore stay yet, thou need’st not to be gone.
ROMEO.
Let me be ta’en, let me be put to death,
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye,
’Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.
Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
I have more care to stay than will to go.
Come, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so.
How is’t, my soul? Let’s talk. It is not day.
JULIET.
It is, it is! Hie hence, be gone, away.
It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
Some say the lark makes sweet division;
This doth not so, for she divideth us.
Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes.
O, now I would they had chang’d voices too,
Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
Hunting thee hence with hunt’s-up to the day.
O now be gone, more light and light it grows.
ROMEO.
More light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
 Enter Nurse.
NURSE.
Madam.
JULIET.
Nurse?
NURSE.
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
The day is broke, be wary, look about.
 [_Exit._]
JULIET.
Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
ROMEO.
Farewell, farewell, one kiss, and I’ll descend.
 [_Descends._]
JULIET.
Art thou gone so? Love, lord, ay husband, friend,
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
For in a minute there are many days.
O, by this count I shall be much in years
Ere I again behold my Romeo.
ROMEO.
Farewell!
I will omit no opportunity
That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
JULIET.
O thinkest thou we shall ever meet again?
ROMEO.
I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serve
For sweet discourses in our time to come.
JULIET.
O God! I have an ill-divining soul!
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,
As one dead in the bottom of a tomb.
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look’st pale.
ROMEO.
And trust me, love, in my eye so do you.
Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu.
 [_Exit below._]
JULIET.
O Fortune, Fortune! All men call thee fickle,
If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him
That is renown’d for faith? Be fickle, Fortune;
For then, I hope thou wilt not keep him long
But send him back.
LADY CAPULET.
[_Within._] Ho, daughter, are you up?
JULIET.
Who is’t that calls? Is it my lady mother?
Is she not down so late, or up so early?
What unaccustom’d cause procures her hither?
 Enter Lady Capulet.
LADY CAPULET.
Why, how now, Juliet?
JULIET.
Madam, I am not well.
LADY CAPULET.
Evermore weeping for your cousin’s death?
What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
And if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live.
Therefore have done: some grief shows much of love,
But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
JULIET.
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
LADY CAPULET.
So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
Which you weep for.
JULIET.
Feeling so the loss,
I cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
LADY CAPULET.
Well, girl, thou weep’st not so much for his death
As that the villain lives which slaughter’d him.
JULIET.
What villain, madam?
LADY CAPULET.
That same villain Romeo.
JULIET.
Villain and he be many miles asunder.
God pardon him. I do, with all my heart.
And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
LADY CAPULET.
That is because the traitor murderer lives.
JULIET.
Ay madam, from the reach of these my hands.
Would none but I might venge my cousin’s death.
LADY CAPULET.
We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not.
Then weep no more. I’ll send to one in Mantua,
Where that same banish’d runagate doth live,
Shall give him such an unaccustom’d dram
That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied.
JULIET.
Indeed I never shall be satisfied
With Romeo till I behold him—dead—
Is my poor heart so for a kinsman vex’d.
Madam, if you could find out but a man
To bear a poison, I would temper it,
That Romeo should upon receipt thereof,
Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
To hear him nam’d, and cannot come to him,
To wreak the love I bore my cousin
Upon his body that hath slaughter’d him.
LADY CAPULET.
Find thou the means, and I’ll find such a man.
But now I’ll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
JULIET.
And joy comes well in such a needy time.
What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
LADY CAPULET.
Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
One who to put thee from thy heaviness,
Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
That thou expects not, nor I look’d not for.
JULIET.
Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
LADY CAPULET.
Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn
The gallant, young, and noble gentleman,
The County Paris, at Saint Peter’s Church,
Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
JULIET.
Now by Saint Peter’s Church, and Peter too,
He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
I wonder at this haste, that I must wed
Ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
I pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
I will not marry yet; and when I do, I swear
It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
Rather than Paris. These are news indeed.
LADY CAPULET.
Here comes your father, tell him so yourself,
And see how he will take it at your hands.
 Enter Capulet and Nurse.
CAPULET.
When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
But for the sunset of my brother’s son
It rains downright.
How now? A conduit, girl? What, still in tears?
Evermore showering? In one little body
Thou counterfeits a bark, a sea, a wind.
For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
Sailing in this salt flood, the winds, thy sighs,
Who raging with thy tears and they with them,
Without a sudden calm will overset
Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife?
Have you deliver’d to her our decree?
LADY CAPULET.
Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
I would the fool were married to her grave.
CAPULET.
Soft. Take me with you, take me with you, wife.
How, will she none? Doth she not give us thanks?
Is she not proud? Doth she not count her blest,
Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
JULIET.
Not proud you have, but thankful that you have.
Proud can I never be of what I hate;
But thankful even for hate that is meant love.
CAPULET.
How now, how now, chopp’d logic? What is this?
Proud, and, I thank you, and I thank you not;
And yet not proud. Mistress minion you,
Thank me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds,
But fettle your fine joints ’gainst Thursday next
To go with Paris to Saint Peter’s Church,
Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
Out, you green-sickness carrion! Out, you baggage!
You tallow-face!
LADY CAPULET.
Fie, fie! What, are you mad?
JULIET.
Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
CAPULET.
Hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch!
I tell thee what,—get thee to church a Thursday,
Or never after look me in the face.
Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.
My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
That God had lent us but this only child;
But now I see this one is one too much,
And that we have a curse in having her.
Out on her, hilding.
NURSE.
God in heaven bless her.
You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
CAPULET.
And why, my lady wisdom? Hold your tongue,
Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
NURSE.
I speak no treason.
CAPULET.
O God ye good-en!
NURSE.
May not one speak?
CAPULET.
Peace, you mumbling fool!
Utter your gravity o’er a gossip’s bowl,
For here we need it not.
LADY CAPULET.
You are too hot.
CAPULET.
God’s bread, it makes me mad!
Day, night, hour, ride, time, work, play,
Alone, in company, still my care hath been
To have her match’d, and having now provided
A gentleman of noble parentage,
Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly allied,
Stuff’d, as they say, with honourable parts,
Proportion’d as one’s thought would wish a man,
And then to have a wretched puling fool,
A whining mammet, in her fortune’s tender,
To answer, ‘I’ll not wed, I cannot love,
I am too young, I pray you pardon me.’
But, and you will not wed, I’ll pardon you.
Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
Look to’t, think on’t, I do not use to jest.
Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise.
And you be mine, I’ll give you to my friend;
And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in the streets,
For by my soul, I’ll ne’er acknowledge thee,
Nor what is mine shall never do thee good.
Trust to’t, bethink you, I’ll not be forsworn.
 [_Exit._]
JULIET.
Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
That sees into the bottom of my grief?
O sweet my mother, cast me not away,
Delay this marriage for a month, a week,
Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
LADY CAPULET.
Talk not to me, for I’ll not speak a word.
Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
 [_Exit._]
JULIET.
O God! O Nurse, how shall this be prevented?
My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven.
How shall that faith return again to earth,
Unless that husband send it me from heaven
By leaving earth? Comfort me, counsel me.
Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
Upon so soft a subject as myself.
What say’st thou? Hast thou not a word of joy?
Some comfort, Nurse.
NURSE.
Faith, here it is.
Romeo is banished; and all the world to nothing
That he dares ne’er come back to challenge you.
Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
I think it best you married with the County.
O, he’s a lovely gentleman.
Romeo’s a dishclout to him. An eagle, madam,
Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
I think you are happy in this second match,
For it excels your first: or if it did not,
Your first is dead, or ’twere as good he were,
As living here and you no use of him.
JULIET.
Speakest thou from thy heart?
NURSE.
And from my soul too,
Or else beshrew them both.
JULIET.
Amen.
NURSE.
What?
JULIET.
Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,
Having displeas’d my father, to Lawrence’ cell,
To make confession and to be absolv’d.
NURSE.
Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
 [_Exit._]
JULIET.
Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
Which she hath prais’d him with above compare
So many thousand times? Go, counsellor.
Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
I’ll to the Friar to know his remedy.
If all else fail, myself have power to die.
 [_Exit._]
ACT IV
SCENE I. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.
 Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
On Thursday, sir? The time is very short.
PARIS.
My father Capulet will have it so;
And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
You say you do not know the lady’s mind.
Uneven is the course; I like it not.
PARIS.
Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt’s death,
And therefore have I little talk’d of love;
For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
That she do give her sorrow so much sway;
And in his wisdom, hastes our marriage,
To stop the inundation of her tears,
Which, too much minded by herself alone,
May be put from her by society.
Now do you know the reason of this haste.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
[_Aside._] I would I knew not why it should be slow’d.—
Look, sir, here comes the lady toward my cell.
 Enter Juliet.
PARIS.
Happily met, my lady and my wife!
JULIET.
That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
PARIS.
That may be, must be, love, on Thursday next.
JULIET.
What must be shall be.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
That’s a certain text.
PARIS.
Come you to make confession to this father?
JULIET.
To answer that, I should confess to you.
PARIS.
Do not deny to him that you love me.
JULIET.
I will confess to you that I love him.
PARIS.
So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
JULIET.
If I do so, it will be of more price,
Being spoke behind your back than to your face.
PARIS.
Poor soul, thy face is much abus’d with tears.
JULIET.
The tears have got small victory by that;
For it was bad enough before their spite.
PARIS.
Thou wrong’st it more than tears with that report.
JULIET.
That is no slander, sir, which is a truth,
And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
PARIS.
Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander’d it.
JULIET.
It may be so, for it is not mine own.
Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.—
My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
PARIS.
God shield I should disturb devotion!—
Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye,
Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
 [_Exit._]
JULIET.
O shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
Come weep with me, past hope, past cure, past help!
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
O Juliet, I already know thy grief;
It strains me past the compass of my wits.
I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
On Thursday next be married to this County.
JULIET.
Tell me not, Friar, that thou hear’st of this,
Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it.
If in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
Do thou but call my resolution wise,
And with this knife I’ll help it presently.
God join’d my heart and Romeo’s, thou our hands;
And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo’s seal’d,
Shall be the label to another deed,
Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
Turn to another, this shall slay them both.
Therefore, out of thy long-experienc’d time,
Give me some present counsel, or behold
’Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
Shall play the empire, arbitrating that
Which the commission of thy years and art
Could to no issue of true honour bring.
Be not so long to speak. I long to die,
If what thou speak’st speak not of remedy.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hold, daughter. I do spy a kind of hope,
Which craves as desperate an execution
As that is desperate which we would prevent.
If, rather than to marry County Paris
Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
A thing like death to chide away this shame,
That cop’st with death himself to scape from it.
And if thou dar’st, I’ll give thee remedy.
JULIET.
O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
From off the battlements of yonder tower,
Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
Where serpents are. Chain me with roaring bears;
Or hide me nightly in a charnel-house,
O’er-cover’d quite with dead men’s rattling bones,
With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls.
Or bid me go into a new-made grave,
And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,
And I will do it without fear or doubt,
To live an unstain’d wife to my sweet love.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hold then. Go home, be merry, give consent
To marry Paris. Wednesday is tomorrow;
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,
Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
And this distilled liquor drink thou off,
When presently through all thy veins shall run
A cold and drowsy humour; for no pulse
Shall keep his native progress, but surcease.
No warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest,
The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
To paly ashes; thy eyes’ windows fall,
Like death when he shuts up the day of life.
Each part depriv’d of supple government,
Shall stiff and stark and cold appear like death.
And in this borrow’d likeness of shrunk death
Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead.
Then as the manner of our country is,
In thy best robes, uncover’d, on the bier,
Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
In the meantime, against thou shalt awake,
Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
And hither shall he come, and he and I
Will watch thy waking, and that very night
Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
And this shall free thee from this present shame,
If no inconstant toy nor womanish fear
Abate thy valour in the acting it.
JULIET.
Give me, give me! O tell not me of fear!
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
In this resolve. I’ll send a friar with speed
To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
JULIET.
Love give me strength, and strength shall help afford.
Farewell, dear father.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE II. Hall in Capulet’s House.
 Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet, Nurse and Servants.
CAPULET.
So many guests invite as here are writ.
 [_Exit first Servant._]
Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.
SECOND SERVANT.
You shall have none ill, sir; for I’ll try if they can lick their
fingers.
CAPULET.
How canst thou try them so?
SECOND SERVANT.
Marry, sir, ’tis an ill cook that cannot lick his own fingers;
therefore he that cannot lick his fingers goes not with me.
CAPULET.
Go, begone.
 [_Exit second Servant._]
We shall be much unfurnish’d for this time.
What, is my daughter gone to Friar Lawrence?
NURSE.
Ay, forsooth.
CAPULET.
Well, he may chance to do some good on her.
A peevish self-will’d harlotry it is.
 Enter Juliet.
NURSE.
See where she comes from shrift with merry look.
CAPULET.
How now, my headstrong. Where have you been gadding?
JULIET.
Where I have learnt me to repent the sin
Of disobedient opposition
To you and your behests; and am enjoin’d
By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here,
To beg your pardon. Pardon, I beseech you.
Henceforward I am ever rul’d by you.
CAPULET.
Send for the County, go tell him of this.
I’ll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.
JULIET.
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence’ cell,
And gave him what becomed love I might,
Not stepping o’er the bounds of modesty.
CAPULET.
Why, I am glad on’t. This is well. Stand up.
This is as’t should be. Let me see the County.
Ay, marry. Go, I say, and fetch him hither.
Now afore God, this reverend holy Friar,
All our whole city is much bound to him.
JULIET.
Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
To help me sort such needful ornaments
As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow?
LADY CAPULET.
No, not till Thursday. There is time enough.
CAPULET.
Go, Nurse, go with her. We’ll to church tomorrow.
 [_Exeunt Juliet and Nurse._]
LADY CAPULET.
We shall be short in our provision,
’Tis now near night.
CAPULET.
Tush, I will stir about,
And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife.
Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her.
I’ll not to bed tonight, let me alone.
I’ll play the housewife for this once.—What, ho!—
They are all forth: well, I will walk myself
To County Paris, to prepare him up
Against tomorrow. My heart is wondrous light
Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim’d.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE III. Juliet’s Chamber.
 Enter Juliet and Nurse.
JULIET.
Ay, those attires are best. But, gentle Nurse,
I pray thee leave me to myself tonight;
For I have need of many orisons
To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
Which, well thou know’st, is cross and full of sin.
 Enter Lady Capulet.
LADY CAPULET.
What, are you busy, ho? Need you my help?
JULIET.
No, madam; we have cull’d such necessaries
As are behoveful for our state tomorrow.
So please you, let me now be left alone,
And let the nurse this night sit up with you,
For I am sure you have your hands full all
In this so sudden business.
LADY CAPULET.
Good night.
Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need.
 [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]
JULIET.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins
That almost freezes up the heat of life.
I’ll call them back again to comfort me.
Nurse!—What should she do here?
My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
Come, vial.
What if this mixture do not work at all?
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
No, No! This shall forbid it. Lie thou there.
 [_Laying down her dagger._]
What if it be a poison, which the Friar
Subtly hath minister’d to have me dead,
Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour’d,
Because he married me before to Romeo?
I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,
For he hath still been tried a holy man.
How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
I wake before the time that Romeo
Come to redeem me? There’s a fearful point!
Shall I not then be stifled in the vault,
To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
Or, if I live, is it not very like,
The horrible conceit of death and night,
Together with the terror of the place,
As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
Where for this many hundred years the bones
Of all my buried ancestors are pack’d,
Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
At some hours in the night spirits resort—
Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
And shrieks like mandrakes torn out of the earth,
That living mortals, hearing them, run mad.
O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
Environed with all these hideous fears,
And madly play with my forefathers’ joints?
And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
And, in this rage, with some great kinsman’s bone,
As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
O look, methinks I see my cousin’s ghost
Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body
Upon a rapier’s point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!
Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here’s drink! I drink to thee.
 [_Throws herself on the bed._]
SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet’s House.
 Enter Lady Capulet and Nurse.
LADY CAPULET.
Hold, take these keys and fetch more spices, Nurse.
NURSE.
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.
 Enter Capulet.
CAPULET.
Come, stir, stir, stir! The second cock hath crow’d,
The curfew bell hath rung, ’tis three o’clock.
Look to the bak’d meats, good Angelica;
Spare not for cost.
NURSE.
Go, you cot-quean, go,
Get you to bed; faith, you’ll be sick tomorrow
For this night’s watching.
CAPULET.
No, not a whit. What! I have watch’d ere now
All night for lesser cause, and ne’er been sick.
LADY CAPULET.
Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
But I will watch you from such watching now.
 [_Exeunt Lady Capulet and Nurse._]
CAPULET.
A jealous-hood, a jealous-hood!
 Enter Servants, with spits, logs and baskets.
Now, fellow, what’s there?
FIRST SERVANT.
Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.
CAPULET.
Make haste, make haste.
 [_Exit First Servant._]
—Sirrah, fetch drier logs.
Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.
SECOND SERVANT.
I have a head, sir, that will find out logs
And never trouble Peter for the matter.
 [_Exit._]
CAPULET.
Mass and well said; a merry whoreson, ha.
Thou shalt be loggerhead.—Good faith, ’tis day.
The County will be here with music straight,
For so he said he would. I hear him near.
 [_Play music._]
Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, Nurse, I say!
 Re-enter Nurse.
Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up.
I’ll go and chat with Paris. Hie, make haste,
Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already.
Make haste I say.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE V. Juliet’s Chamber; Juliet on the bed.
 Enter Nurse.
NURSE.
Mistress! What, mistress! Juliet! Fast, I warrant her, she.
Why, lamb, why, lady, fie, you slug-abed!
Why, love, I say! Madam! Sweetheart! Why, bride!
What, not a word? You take your pennyworths now.
Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
The County Paris hath set up his rest
That you shall rest but little. God forgive me!
Marry and amen. How sound is she asleep!
I needs must wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
Ay, let the County take you in your bed,
He’ll fright you up, i’faith. Will it not be?
What, dress’d, and in your clothes, and down again?
I must needs wake you. Lady! Lady! Lady!
Alas, alas! Help, help! My lady’s dead!
O, well-a-day that ever I was born.
Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! My lady!
 Enter Lady Capulet.
LADY CAPULET.
What noise is here?
NURSE.
O lamentable day!
LADY CAPULET.
What is the matter?
NURSE.
Look, look! O heavy day!
LADY CAPULET.
O me, O me! My child, my only life.
Revive, look up, or I will die with thee.
Help, help! Call help.
 Enter Capulet.
CAPULET.
For shame, bring Juliet forth, her lord is come.
NURSE.
She’s dead, deceas’d, she’s dead; alack the day!
LADY CAPULET.
Alack the day, she’s dead, she’s dead, she’s dead!
CAPULET.
Ha! Let me see her. Out alas! She’s cold,
Her blood is settled and her joints are stiff.
Life and these lips have long been separated.
Death lies on her like an untimely frost
Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
NURSE.
O lamentable day!
LADY CAPULET.
O woful time!
CAPULET.
Death, that hath ta’en her hence to make me wail,
Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak.
 Enter Friar Lawrence and Paris with Musicians.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
CAPULET.
Ready to go, but never to return.
O son, the night before thy wedding day
Hath death lain with thy bride. There she lies,
Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
Death is my son-in-law, death is my heir;
My daughter he hath wedded. I will die.
And leave him all; life, living, all is death’s.
PARIS.
Have I thought long to see this morning’s face,
And doth it give me such a sight as this?
LADY CAPULET.
Accurs’d, unhappy, wretched, hateful day.
Most miserable hour that e’er time saw
In lasting labour of his pilgrimage.
But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
And cruel death hath catch’d it from my sight.
NURSE.
O woe! O woeful, woeful, woeful day.
Most lamentable day, most woeful day
That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
O day, O day, O day, O hateful day.
Never was seen so black a day as this.
O woeful day, O woeful day.
PARIS.
Beguil’d, divorced, wronged, spited, slain.
Most detestable death, by thee beguil’d,
By cruel, cruel thee quite overthrown.
O love! O life! Not life, but love in death!
CAPULET.
Despis’d, distressed, hated, martyr’d, kill’d.
Uncomfortable time, why cam’st thou now
To murder, murder our solemnity?
O child! O child! My soul, and not my child,
Dead art thou. Alack, my child is dead,
And with my child my joys are buried.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Peace, ho, for shame. Confusion’s cure lives not
In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
Had part in this fair maid, now heaven hath all,
And all the better is it for the maid.
Your part in her you could not keep from death,
But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
The most you sought was her promotion,
For ’twas your heaven she should be advanc’d,
And weep ye now, seeing she is advanc’d
Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
O, in this love, you love your child so ill
That you run mad, seeing that she is well.
She’s not well married that lives married long,
But she’s best married that dies married young.
Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
On this fair corse, and, as the custom is,
And in her best array bear her to church;
For though fond nature bids us all lament,
Yet nature’s tears are reason’s merriment.
CAPULET.
All things that we ordained festival
Turn from their office to black funeral:
Our instruments to melancholy bells,
Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast;
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change;
Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
And all things change them to the contrary.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Sir, go you in, and, madam, go with him,
And go, Sir Paris, everyone prepare
To follow this fair corse unto her grave.
The heavens do lower upon you for some ill;
Move them no more by crossing their high will.
 [_Exeunt Capulet, Lady Capulet, Paris and Friar._]
FIRST MUSICIAN.
Faith, we may put up our pipes and be gone.
NURSE.
Honest good fellows, ah, put up, put up,
For well you know this is a pitiful case.
FIRST MUSICIAN.
Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.
 [_Exit Nurse._]
 Enter Peter.
PETER.
Musicians, O, musicians, ‘Heart’s ease,’ ‘Heart’s ease’, O, and you
will have me live, play ‘Heart’s ease.’
FIRST MUSICIAN.
Why ‘Heart’s ease’?
PETER.
O musicians, because my heart itself plays ‘My heart is full’. O play
me some merry dump to comfort me.
FIRST MUSICIAN.
Not a dump we, ’tis no time to play now.
PETER.
You will not then?
FIRST MUSICIAN.
No.
PETER.
I will then give it you soundly.
FIRST MUSICIAN.
What will you give us?
PETER.
No money, on my faith, but the gleek! I will give you the minstrel.
FIRST MUSICIAN.
Then will I give you the serving-creature.
PETER.
Then will I lay the serving-creature’s dagger on your pate. I will
carry no crotchets. I’ll re you, I’ll fa you. Do you note me?
FIRST MUSICIAN.
And you re us and fa us, you note us.
SECOND MUSICIAN.
Pray you put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
PETER.
Then have at you with my wit. I will dry-beat you with an iron wit, and
put up my iron dagger. Answer me like men.
    ‘When griping griefs the heart doth wound,
      And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    Then music with her silver sound’—
Why ‘silver sound’? Why ‘music with her silver sound’? What say you,
Simon Catling?
FIRST MUSICIAN.
Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
PETER.
Prates. What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
SECOND MUSICIAN.
I say ‘silver sound’ because musicians sound for silver.
PETER.
Prates too! What say you, James Soundpost?
THIRD MUSICIAN.
Faith, I know not what to say.
PETER.
O, I cry you mercy, you are the singer. I will say for you. It is
‘music with her silver sound’ because musicians have no gold for
sounding.
      ‘Then music with her silver sound
      With speedy help doth lend redress.’
 [_Exit._]
FIRST MUSICIAN.
What a pestilent knave is this same!
SECOND MUSICIAN.
Hang him, Jack. Come, we’ll in here, tarry for the mourners, and stay
dinner.
 [_Exeunt._]
ACT V
SCENE I. Mantua. A Street.
 Enter Romeo.
ROMEO.
If I may trust the flattering eye of sleep,
My dreams presage some joyful news at hand.
My bosom’s lord sits lightly in his throne;
And all this day an unaccustom’d spirit
Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
I dreamt my lady came and found me dead,—
Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave to think!—
And breath’d such life with kisses in my lips,
That I reviv’d, and was an emperor.
Ah me, how sweet is love itself possess’d,
When but love’s shadows are so rich in joy.
 Enter Balthasar.
News from Verona! How now, Balthasar?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the Friar?
How doth my lady? Is my father well?
How fares my Juliet? That I ask again;
For nothing can be ill if she be well.
BALTHASAR.
Then she is well, and nothing can be ill.
Her body sleeps in Capel’s monument,
And her immortal part with angels lives.
I saw her laid low in her kindred’s vault,
And presently took post to tell it you.
O pardon me for bringing these ill news,
Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
ROMEO.
Is it even so? Then I defy you, stars!
Thou know’st my lodging. Get me ink and paper,
And hire post-horses. I will hence tonight.
BALTHASAR.
I do beseech you sir, have patience.
Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
Some misadventure.
ROMEO.
Tush, thou art deceiv’d.
Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
Hast thou no letters to me from the Friar?
BALTHASAR.
No, my good lord.
ROMEO.
No matter. Get thee gone,
And hire those horses. I’ll be with thee straight.
 [_Exit Balthasar._]
Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight.
Let’s see for means. O mischief thou art swift
To enter in the thoughts of desperate men.
I do remember an apothecary,—
And hereabouts he dwells,—which late I noted
In tatter’d weeds, with overwhelming brows,
Culling of simples, meagre were his looks,
Sharp misery had worn him to the bones;
And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuff’d, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
A beggarly account of empty boxes,
Green earthen pots, bladders, and musty seeds,
Remnants of packthread, and old cakes of roses
Were thinly scatter’d, to make up a show.
Noting this penury, to myself I said,
And if a man did need a poison now,
Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.
O, this same thought did but forerun my need,
And this same needy man must sell it me.
As I remember, this should be the house.
Being holiday, the beggar’s shop is shut.
What, ho! Apothecary!
 Enter Apothecary.
APOTHECARY.
Who calls so loud?
ROMEO.
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.
Hold, there is forty ducats. Let me have
A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
As will disperse itself through all the veins,
That the life-weary taker may fall dead,
And that the trunk may be discharg’d of breath
As violently as hasty powder fir’d
Doth hurry from the fatal cannon’s womb.
APOTHECARY.
Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua’s law
Is death to any he that utters them.
ROMEO.
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
And fear’st to die? Famine is in thy cheeks,
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back.
The world is not thy friend, nor the world’s law;
The world affords no law to make thee rich;
Then be not poor, but break it and take this.
APOTHECARY.
My poverty, but not my will consents.
ROMEO.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
APOTHECARY.
Put this in any liquid thing you will
And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
Of twenty men, it would despatch you straight.
ROMEO.
There is thy gold, worse poison to men’s souls,
Doing more murder in this loathsome world
Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
I sell thee poison, thou hast sold me none.
Farewell, buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
To Juliet’s grave, for there must I use thee.
 [_Exeunt._]
SCENE II. Friar Lawrence’s Cell.
 Enter Friar John.
FRIAR JOHN.
Holy Franciscan Friar! Brother, ho!
 Enter Friar Lawrence.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
This same should be the voice of Friar John.
Welcome from Mantua. What says Romeo?
Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
FRIAR JOHN.
Going to find a barefoot brother out,
One of our order, to associate me,
Here in this city visiting the sick,
And finding him, the searchers of the town,
Suspecting that we both were in a house
Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
Seal’d up the doors, and would not let us forth,
So that my speed to Mantua there was stay’d.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Who bare my letter then to Romeo?
FRIAR JOHN.
I could not send it,—here it is again,—
Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
So fearful were they of infection.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Unhappy fortune! By my brotherhood,
The letter was not nice, but full of charge,
Of dear import, and the neglecting it
May do much danger. Friar John, go hence,
Get me an iron crow and bring it straight
Unto my cell.
FRIAR JOHN.
Brother, I’ll go and bring it thee.
 [_Exit._]
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Now must I to the monument alone.
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake.
She will beshrew me much that Romeo
Hath had no notice of these accidents;
But I will write again to Mantua,
And keep her at my cell till Romeo come.
Poor living corse, clos’d in a dead man’s tomb.
 [_Exit._]
SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a Monument belonging to the Capulets.
 Enter Paris, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch.
PARIS.
Give me thy torch, boy. Hence and stand aloof.
Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
Under yond yew tree lay thee all along,
Holding thy ear close to the hollow ground;
So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
But thou shalt hear it. Whistle then to me,
As signal that thou hear’st something approach.
Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
PAGE.
[_Aside._] I am almost afraid to stand alone
Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
 [_Retires._]
PARIS.
Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew.
O woe, thy canopy is dust and stones,
Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
Or wanting that, with tears distill’d by moans.
The obsequies that I for thee will keep,
Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
 [_The Page whistles._]
The boy gives warning something doth approach.
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight,
To cross my obsequies and true love’s rite?
What, with a torch! Muffle me, night, awhile.
 [_Retires._]
 Enter Romeo and Balthasar with a torch, mattock, &c.
ROMEO.
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
Give me the light; upon thy life I charge thee,
Whate’er thou hear’st or seest, stand all aloof
And do not interrupt me in my course.
Why I descend into this bed of death
Is partly to behold my lady’s face,
But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
A precious ring, a ring that I must use
In dear employment. Therefore hence, be gone.
But if thou jealous dost return to pry
In what I further shall intend to do,
By heaven I will tear thee joint by joint,
And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs.
The time and my intents are savage-wild;
More fierce and more inexorable far
Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
BALTHASAR.
I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
ROMEO.
So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that.
Live, and be prosperous, and farewell, good fellow.
BALTHASAR.
For all this same, I’ll hide me hereabout.
His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
 [_Retires_]
ROMEO.
Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
Gorg’d with the dearest morsel of the earth,
Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
 [_Breaking open the door of the monument._]
And in despite, I’ll cram thee with more food.
PARIS.
This is that banish’d haughty Montague
That murder’d my love’s cousin,—with which grief,
It is supposed, the fair creature died,—
And here is come to do some villanous shame
To the dead bodies. I will apprehend him.
 [_Advances._]
Stop thy unhallow’d toil, vile Montague.
Can vengeance be pursu’d further than death?
Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee.
Obey, and go with me, for thou must die.
ROMEO.
I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man.
Fly hence and leave me. Think upon these gone;
Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
Put not another sin upon my head
By urging me to fury. O be gone.
By heaven I love thee better than myself;
For I come hither arm’d against myself.
Stay not, be gone, live, and hereafter say,
A madman’s mercy bid thee run away.
PARIS.
I do defy thy conjuration,
And apprehend thee for a felon here.
ROMEO.
Wilt thou provoke me? Then have at thee, boy!
 [_They fight._]
PAGE.
O lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
 [_Exit._]
PARIS.
O, I am slain! [_Falls._] If thou be merciful,
Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
 [_Dies._]
ROMEO.
In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
Mercutio’s kinsman, noble County Paris!
What said my man, when my betossed soul
Did not attend him as we rode? I think
He told me Paris should have married Juliet.
Said he not so? Or did I dream it so?
Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
One writ with me in sour misfortune’s book.
I’ll bury thee in a triumphant grave.
A grave? O no, a lantern, slaught’red youth,
For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
This vault a feasting presence full of light.
Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr’d.
 [_Laying Paris in the monument._]
How oft when men are at the point of death
Have they been merry! Which their keepers call
A lightning before death. O, how may I
Call this a lightning? O my love, my wife,
Death that hath suck’d the honey of thy breath,
Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
Thou art not conquer’d. Beauty’s ensign yet
Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
And death’s pale flag is not advanced there.
Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
O, what more favour can I do to thee
Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
To sunder his that was thine enemy?
Forgive me, cousin. Ah, dear Juliet,
Why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe
That unsubstantial death is amorous;
And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
For fear of that I still will stay with thee,
And never from this palace of dim night
Depart again. Here, here will I remain
With worms that are thy chambermaids. O, here
Will I set up my everlasting rest;
And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last.
Arms, take your last embrace! And, lips, O you
The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.
Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide.
Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark.
Here’s to my love! [_Drinks._] O true apothecary!
Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
 [_Dies._]
 Enter, at the other end of the Churchyard, Friar Lawrence, with a
 lantern, crow, and spade.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Saint Francis be my speed. How oft tonight
Have my old feet stumbled at graves? Who’s there?
Who is it that consorts, so late, the dead?
BALTHASAR.
Here’s one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Bliss be upon you. Tell me, good my friend,
What torch is yond that vainly lends his light
To grubs and eyeless skulls? As I discern,
It burneth in the Capels’ monument.
BALTHASAR.
It doth so, holy sir, and there’s my master,
One that you love.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Who is it?
BALTHASAR.
Romeo.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
How long hath he been there?
BALTHASAR.
Full half an hour.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Go with me to the vault.
BALTHASAR.
I dare not, sir;
My master knows not but I am gone hence,
And fearfully did menace me with death
If I did stay to look on his intents.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Stay then, I’ll go alone. Fear comes upon me.
O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
BALTHASAR.
As I did sleep under this yew tree here,
I dreamt my master and another fought,
And that my master slew him.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
Romeo! [_Advances._]
Alack, alack, what blood is this which stains
The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
What mean these masterless and gory swords
To lie discolour’d by this place of peace?
 [_Enters the monument._]
Romeo! O, pale! Who else? What, Paris too?
And steep’d in blood? Ah what an unkind hour
Is guilty of this lamentable chance?
The lady stirs.
 [_Juliet wakes and stirs._]
JULIET.
O comfortable Friar, where is my lord?
I do remember well where I should be,
And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
 [_Noise within._]
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep.
A greater power than we can contradict
Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
And Paris too. Come, I’ll dispose of thee
Among a sisterhood of holy nuns.
Stay not to question, for the watch is coming.
Come, go, good Juliet. I dare no longer stay.
JULIET.
Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
 [_Exit Friar Lawrence._]
What’s here? A cup clos’d in my true love’s hand?
Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
O churl. Drink all, and left no friendly drop
To help me after? I will kiss thy lips.
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
To make me die with a restorative.
 [_Kisses him._]
Thy lips are warm!
FIRST WATCH.
[_Within._] Lead, boy. Which way?
JULIET.
Yea, noise? Then I’ll be brief. O happy dagger.
 [_Snatching Romeo’s dagger._]
This is thy sheath. [_stabs herself_] There rest, and let me die.
 [_Falls on Romeo’s body and dies._]
 Enter Watch with the Page of Paris.
PAGE.
This is the place. There, where the torch doth burn.
FIRST WATCH.
The ground is bloody. Search about the churchyard.
Go, some of you, whoe’er you find attach.
 [_Exeunt some of the Watch._]
Pitiful sight! Here lies the County slain,
And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
Who here hath lain this two days buried.
Go tell the Prince; run to the Capulets.
Raise up the Montagues, some others search.
 [_Exeunt others of the Watch._]
We see the ground whereon these woes do lie,
But the true ground of all these piteous woes
We cannot without circumstance descry.
 Re-enter some of the Watch with Balthasar.
SECOND WATCH.
Here’s Romeo’s man. We found him in the churchyard.
FIRST WATCH.
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither.
 Re-enter others of the Watch with Friar Lawrence.
THIRD WATCH. Here is a Friar that trembles, sighs, and weeps.
We took this mattock and this spade from him
As he was coming from this churchyard side.
FIRST WATCH.
A great suspicion. Stay the Friar too.
 Enter the Prince and Attendants.
PRINCE.
What misadventure is so early up,
That calls our person from our morning’s rest?
 Enter Capulet, Lady Capulet and others.
CAPULET.
What should it be that they so shriek abroad?
LADY CAPULET.
O the people in the street cry Romeo,
Some Juliet, and some Paris, and all run
With open outcry toward our monument.
PRINCE.
What fear is this which startles in our ears?
FIRST WATCH.
Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain,
And Romeo dead, and Juliet, dead before,
Warm and new kill’d.
PRINCE.
Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
FIRST WATCH.
Here is a Friar, and slaughter’d Romeo’s man,
With instruments upon them fit to open
These dead men’s tombs.
CAPULET.
O heaven! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
This dagger hath mista’en, for lo, his house
Is empty on the back of Montague,
And it mis-sheathed in my daughter’s bosom.
LADY CAPULET.
O me! This sight of death is as a bell
That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
 Enter Montague and others.
PRINCE.
Come, Montague, for thou art early up,
To see thy son and heir more early down.
MONTAGUE.
Alas, my liege, my wife is dead tonight.
Grief of my son’s exile hath stopp’d her breath.
What further woe conspires against mine age?
PRINCE.
Look, and thou shalt see.
MONTAGUE.
O thou untaught! What manners is in this,
To press before thy father to a grave?
PRINCE.
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
Till we can clear these ambiguities,
And know their spring, their head, their true descent,
And then will I be general of your woes,
And lead you even to death. Meantime forbear,
And let mischance be slave to patience.
Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
I am the greatest, able to do least,
Yet most suspected, as the time and place
Doth make against me, of this direful murder.
And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
Myself condemned and myself excus’d.
PRINCE.
Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
FRIAR LAWRENCE.
I will be brief, for my short date of breath
Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet,
And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife.
I married them; and their stol’n marriage day
Was Tybalt’s doomsday, whose untimely death
Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city;
For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin’d.
You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
Betroth’d, and would have married her perforce
To County Paris. Then comes she to me,
And with wild looks, bid me devise some means
To rid her from this second marriage,
Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,
A sleeping potion, which so took effect
As I intended, for it wrought on her
The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo
That he should hither come as this dire night
To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,
Being the time the potion’s force should cease.
But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
Was stay’d by accident; and yesternight
Return’d my letter back. Then all alone
At the prefixed hour of her waking
Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault,
Meaning to keep her closely at my cell
Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.
But when I came, some minute ere the time
Of her awaking, here untimely lay
The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
She wakes; and I entreated her come forth
And bear this work of heaven with patience.
But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
All this I know; and to the marriage
Her Nurse is privy. And if ought in this
Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
Be sacrific’d, some hour before his time,
Unto the rigour of severest law.
PRINCE.
We still have known thee for a holy man.
Where’s Romeo’s man? What can he say to this?
BALTHASAR.
I brought my master news of Juliet’s death,
And then in post he came from Mantua
To this same place, to this same monument.
This letter he early bid me give his father,
And threaten’d me with death, going in the vault,
If I departed not, and left him there.
PRINCE.
Give me the letter, I will look on it.
Where is the County’s Page that rais’d the watch?
Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
PAGE.
He came with flowers to strew his lady’s grave,
And bid me stand aloof, and so I did.
Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb,
And by and by my master drew on him,
And then I ran away to call the watch.
PRINCE.
This letter doth make good the Friar’s words,
Their course of love, the tidings of her death.
And here he writes that he did buy a poison
Of a poor ’pothecary, and therewithal
Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
Where be these enemies? Capulet, Montague,
See what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love!
And I, for winking at your discords too,
Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punish’d.
CAPULET.
O brother Montague, give me thy hand.
This is my daughter’s jointure, for no more
Can I demand.
MONTAGUE.
But I can give thee more,
For I will raise her statue in pure gold,
That whiles Verona by that name is known,
There shall no figure at such rate be set
As that of true and faithful Juliet.
CAPULET.
As rich shall Romeo’s by his lady’s lie,
Poor sacrifices of our enmity.
PRINCE.
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
The sun for sorrow will not show his head.
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.
Some shall be pardon’d, and some punished,
For never was a story of more woe
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm
Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation
Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate
Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
